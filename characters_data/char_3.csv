"","NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM","DPSRegarding Weapon Choices:The Black Sword: With an EM sand, this combo has the highest Melt/Vaporize damage. Iron Sting: This weapon at [R1] with an Elemental Mastery sand turns out to have diminishing returns and isn't as good, but [R2+] Iron Sting is a different question because better buffs.Aquila Favonia: Assuming you have a high investment build's CR/CD stats, this weapon with EM sands will be better than the two above.Primordial Jade Cutter: With Thundering Fury (4), this weapon is able to out-perform Mistsplitter Reforged due to massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows consistent Vaporize damage despite the lack of Crit Rate/DMG substats, assuming that your EM Sands/Circlet lacks crit rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter Reforged easily overtakes the Primordial Jade Cutter.The Alley Flash: This weapon has the potential to beat Iron Sting [R5], but this requires the passive to be up, whenever damaged, your passive is disabled for 5 seconds and you could be losing out a lot of damage, especially if you are constantly being damaged.Regarding Artifact Sets:Crimson Witch of Flames (4): Assuming a Melt/Vaporize team, this set is your best set for damage and works best with Chongyun on the same team for consistent Melt.Thundering Fury (4): This set works best if paired with Electro supports such as Beidou and Fischl/Lisa, as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things: >1) Rapidly spam E for raw Pyro damage and application, allowing frequent Overload reaction triggers and breaking Electro shields rapidly.>2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team. The setup is generally only recommended for those with Beidou [C2/C6].The main-stat artifacts you want to farm for Thundering Fury (4) Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go for the other builds. Instead of ATK%/EM, Pyro and Crit, you'd instead want to go for EM, Pyro and EM on a Thundering Fury (4) Bennett. As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as Iron Sting take priority over other swords. Recommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. With Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.BURST SUPPORTA Burst Support Bennett completely ignores the need for excess healing potential and is aimed for people who prefer to squeeze out more damage instead. On this build, Bennett is built with offensive stats like ATK%, Pyro Damage, and Crit stats while having a good amount of Energy Recharge to burst off cooldown. Prioritize Energy Recharge before offensive stats if you cannot cast your Elemental Burst off cooldown.SUPPORTHeals from his Elemental Burst scale off of HP, while his damage buff from Burst only scales with your base ATK (Character Base ATK stat and Weapon Base ATK stat)DO NOT increase Bennett's constellation from 5 to 6 unless he is in a Pyro team and you know what you're doing. This is because Bennett turns all of your melee on-field character's Auto Attacks into Pyro, which means that Bennett will lose a lot of his team comp potential.Although Bennett is usually considered a healer, he already heals a lot even without necessarily building for HP%, if you find it unnecessary to build for HP%, you can consider building him as a Burst Support.Regarding Weapon Choices:Mistsplitter Reforged, Aquila Favonia: These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.Freedom-Sworn: In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.The Alley Flash: This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward Blade).Prototype Rancour: This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)Regarding Artifact Sets:Instructor (4): The best option for teams that benefit more from Elemental Mastery boosts than ATK increases and where you can equip the Noblesse Oblige (4) set on a different character with minimal or no damage reduction.",""

This means that Sacrificial Greatsword and Xinyan's [C2] are crucial to making this set shine on her. This set isn't as recommended for her if you have neither of the two.Shield uptime is also crucial to maximizing her Physical/Shield Support capabilities. If you have neither Sacrificial Greatsword nor at least [C2] (but ideally [C4]) on Xinyan, you may want to build her as a DPS instead of Physical/Shield Support.Generally not recommended for Pyro Applications, as the pulses only happen at Shield Level 3, and are not very efficient at breaking Cryo shields.Credit to the In-progress KQM Guide draft",""

"","NOTES","DPSYanfei can have trouble trying to set up for her reaction DPS. Vaporize is generally the more consistent option and you need Xingqiu to make this work best. When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3 normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest and most reliable way to Vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure you're applying Hydro first before starting combos.Regarding Weapon Choices:Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds / Kagura's Verity: Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) will push Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds and Kagura's Verity ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust.The Widsith: Note that with strong attack buffs like Bennett's Burst, an [R5] Widsith can outperform most [R1] 5-star weapons, with the exception of Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.Dodoco Tales: On equal refinements, The Widsith is better than Dodoco Tales, but assuming it's [R5] Dodoco Tales vs [R1]-[R3] The Widsith, [R5] Dodoco Tales is better. Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff may push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.Regarding Artifact Sets:Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Yanfei will rarely have her burst up due to the 15 energy cost on the 4-piece effect, however she can instead maintain the 4-piece DMG buff over a longer duration, making this set a good alternative to the other options. Note that this set loses out on some value at higher constellations, as she can't get her [C4] effects without casting Burst.Gilded Dreams (4): Actually her BiS if used in a full Elemental Mastery build with a Overload team.Retracing Bolide (4): Running Yanfei with a shield character also allows you to make use of a full Retracing Bolide (4) as a placeholder until you're able to find a good Crimson Witch of Flames (4). Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: Energy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as potential Pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the value of the particles.SHIELD SUPPORTThis section is dedicated to a playstyle where Yanfei is utilised as a primary shielder through her 4th Constellation. Due to the requirement of having to burst off cooldown, this build has high energy requirements.",""

"","NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM","BURGEONThis build focuses on using Thoma as a trigger unit for Burgeon reactions.

However, if you can manage to reliably proc the passive, it will perform better than Kitain Cross Spear.Regarding Artifact sets:Instructor (4): This set ideally works best in heavily reaction focused teams like Hu Tao Vape where the Elemental Mastery is utilized well.

Check out the in-depth guide to learn in-depth about animation cancelling which may help with this issue.Regarding Weapon Choice:Memory of Dust: This weapon's rankings assume that Klee is played without a shielder, as forcing a shielder for the additional 20 ATK% leads to a damage loss compared to her best teams, even if said shielder is Zhongli. If in a situation where Klee is played with a shielder anyway, this weapon would be on par with Skyward Atlas.Solar Pearl: When using Solar Pearl, it is recommended to animation cancel a Normal Attack into an Elemental Skill and cancel that into her Elemental Burst at the start of her field time.Regarding Artifact Sets:Lavawalker (4): Klee's kit makes it harder to utilize Vaporize and Melt the same way another Pyro carry would, but her constant Pyro application makes Lavawalker (4) a viable set. See KleefulFrame's great number breakdown here.Crimson Witch of Flames (4): This set is only recommended in a team where Klee is able to trigger Vaporize consistently.Wanderer's Troupe (4): This set increases the Charged Attack by another 35% Damage Bonus. It can serve as a decent DPS choice but due to how clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in actual practice as it requires you to dodge more and consume more stamina, not to mention how the DPS gets caught up by the other builds mentioned above.",""

"","NOTES","DPSHu Tao is most effective when used with Xingqiu to proc Vaporize/Freeze Melt reactions. Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since unlike Diluc or Klee, Hu Tao doesn't shatter frozen enemies.Regarding Weapon Choices:Staff of the Scarlet Sands: When using this weapon, Gilded Dreams (4) becomes competitive with Crimson Witch of Flames (4) for being Hu Tao's best artifact set.Ballad of the Fjords and Lithic Spear (4 Stacks): At [R5], these weapons are better than Staff of the Scarlet Sands.Primordial Jade Winged-Spear: Is better than the [R1] variants of Dragon's Bane and Deathmatch with ideal stacking. While this is a very strong weapon when fully stacked, maintaining the stacks on Hu Tao isn't ideal in realistic situations making the weapon less consistent than other options.Deathmatch: This weapon is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing Vaporize.Blackcliff Pole: Despite seeming quite good due to the Crit DMG substat, Blackcliff Pole at 1 stack performs only slightly better than an [R5] White Tassel in practice as it is difficult to maintain stacks consistently. It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.White Tassel: This weapon prefers an N2C combo over an N1C combo.Regarding Artifact Sets: Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Provides higher Normal and Charged Attack damage than Crimson Witch of Flames (4) but lowers your Elemental Burst damage which hurts your AoE damage, also if you're unable to burst, it might cause survivability issues if you're not running a healer.Gilded Dreams (4): At 3 EM stacks, this artifact set is equal to Crimson Witch of Flames (4) in teams where you are not getting EM from other sources (e.g team or weapon). Retracing Bolide (4) and Crimson Witch of Flames (2) / Tenacity of the Millelith (2) + 80 EM set (2): All these options are almost on equal footing because both of the sets have an equal overall damage output assuming you have 100% shield uptime when using Retracing Bolide (4). The difference is, you want to use +80 EM set (2) / +20% HP (2) / Crimson's Witch of Flame (2) when focusing on Nuking and better consistency, while Retracing Bolide (4) is for overall higher AA damage at the expense of lower burst damage, although inconsistent if you cannot keep your shield permanently.Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: Since Hu Tao is able to trigger Vaporize on most of her damage output, Elemental Mastery is quite valuable on her. If you have less than 100EM total (including from Sucrose EM share, Instructor (4), etc) EM substats take priority over Crit Rate / DMG.",""

"","NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM","DPSRegarding Weapon Choices: Aqua Simulacra: This weapon requires Yoimiya to be very close to enemies (~8m). As such, this weapon is recommended only with a good shielder. Slingshot [R5]: This ranking is assuming you're using either Yun Jin or Bennett in your team. While using both Yun Jin and Bennett, this weapon can potentially beat Rust [R5].Amos' Bow: This weapon's ranking is assuming low stacks of its passive due to you ideally being close to enemies to consistently hit all attacks in your combo. When at 3 stacks, this weapon can be close to Slingshot [R5]. Use it if it's already built for another character and you don't want to invest in Slingshot just for Yoimiya.Rust: At [R4] this weapon performs better than Polar Star, and at [R5] performs better than Aqua Simulacra.Regarding Artifacts:  Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): This set is her Best in Slot in the vast majority of situations even when considering inconsistent Burst usage (once every 3-4 rotations).Crimson Witch of Flames (4): Usable in Vaporize teams and can be her Best in Slot for teams where she procs Vaporize and Overload (such as teams with a Fischl flex or Fischl + Beidou taser core)Gilded Dreams (4): This artifact set is significantly worse in teams where Yoimiya is not triggering Elemental Reactions.Echoes of an Offering (4): This set has a lot of caveats that generally warrant it being a subpar choice. Its effects proccing is tied to your connection to the servers, so if your ping is above 100 and/or you have an unstable connection (fluctuations), you should avoid this set. Additionally, the RNG nature of its procs makes it unreliable in Vaporize teams as you can't guarantee it working on N1, N3 and N5 (her vaporized hits). Retracing Bolide (4): This set is only recommended to be used with a shielder. This set is also very resin inefficient, so its not recommended to farm for this set specifically.Crimson Witch of Flames (2) +18% ATK set (2): While lacking in power compared to the other options, you will likely have good substats on the 2 piece combinations compared to a full 4 piece set which can compensate.Regarding Mainstats:Elemental Mastery: A good option if Yoimiya is triggering Vaporize and/or Overload. Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.Regarding Talent Priorities: Her Skill has poor scaling which results in individual upgrades not affecting your damage much. Her Burst is also low priority due to it being used once every few rotations in some scenarios (such as when using Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) without an abundance of off field energy) which can reduce its effectiveness.
