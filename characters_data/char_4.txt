,NOTES,OFF-FIELD DPS Elemental Burst and Skill both summon Oz, so make sure you're only using one at a time. Start with your Skill, use Burst for second Oz rotation and alternate. Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of Oz summoning is over, you'll have gained enough energy to repeat the loop.Regarding Weapon Choices: In general, Fischl's rankings depend significantly on the refinements of her weapons. Alley Hunter: At [R5] this weapon can be similar in performance to Skyward Harp and Thundering Pulse.The Stringless: At [R5] this weapon can be on par with Amos' Bow / Alley Hunter [R1] / The Viridescent Hunt.Prototype Crescent: If you can consistently hit a weakpoint on an enemy before summoning Oz, this weapon performs better than Fading Twilight.Polar Star: Perform a quick normal attack and charged attack before summoning Oz for more stacks.Regarding Artifact Sets:Golden Troupe (4): This set provides a significant amount of Elemental Skill DMG% and outperforms other set options by a large margin for personal damage.Thundersoother (4): This artifact set will outperform +18% ATK set (2) Thundering Fury (2) if used in a team comp where an Electro aura is always present (e.g. Electro/Electro-charged comps) therefore it is highly recommended within this niche.Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set trades off a portion of Fischl's damage in return for a party wide 20% ATK buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her in specific teams. Fischl can benefit from the 20% ATK buff herself if she summons Oz within 3 seconds of his previous attack. Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Fischl. OFF-FIELD AGGRAVATE DPSRegarding Weapon Choices: Polar Star: Perform a quick normal attack and charged attack before summoning Oz for more stacks.Alley Hunter: At [R5] this weapon can be similar in performance to Skyward Harp.The Stringless: At [R5] this weapon can be stronger than Skyward Harp / Alley Hunter [R5].,

,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom Beidou Mains + KQM,OFF-FIELD AGGRAVATE & OFF-FIELD DPSRegarding Weapon Choices:Serpent Spine: This weapon is a fine choice for Off-Field DPS Beidou and can outperform Wolf's Gravestone by a significant margin when Bennett/Sara ATK buffs are applied. Be sure to use Beidou in slot 1 to pre-stack Serpent Spine before starting an abyss floor. At high refinement, Serpent Spine has the potential to be Beidou's best weapon, especially at low-medium ER requirements.Redhorn Stonethresher and Beacon of the Reed Sea: Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, these weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage. Beacon ranking assumes one stack.Akuoumaru: Assuming 260 team energy, this weapon outperforms Skyward Pride on a low ER requirement Beidou (where she is paired with other Electro characters to battery her energy needs). At [R3+], it becomes exponentially better and comes very close to Serpent Spine and Wolf's Gravestone.Rainslasher: At max refinement in Aggravate teams this weapon will perform slightly better than Luxurious Sea-Lord.Regarding Artifact Sets:Emblem of Severed Fate (4): Even after considering the 4-piece set effect, you should refrain from investing into Energy Recharge beyond what is needed to burst off cooldown as it will result in a damage loss as compared to prioritising offensive stats such as ATK/Crit. In team comps where Beidou has low ER requirements (i.e. when paired with Electro batteries), a Noblesse Oblige (2) / Thundering Fury (2) / +18% ATK set (2) [Choose Two] will outperform Emblem of Severed Fate (4).Thundersoother (4): This set works best in teams where you can maintain near perfect uptime on its passive, such as in Electro-Charged, Mono Electro and Aggravate teams.,

,NOTESIn-depth Guide from Lisa Mains + KQM,AGGRAVATE DPSThis build makes the best use of Lisa's entire kit, from her EM ascension stat to her high rate of Electro application. While also minimizing her high energy needs by making her an on-field driver for Quicken teams, and is therefore her best usage case.Regarding Weapons:For more details see the sheet hereThe Widsith: At high refinement [R4-R5] this weapon starts performing similarly to Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.Solar Pearl: At high refinement [R4-R5] this is competitive or even slightly better than Skyward Atlas, especially with external attack buffs.Regarding Artifact Sets:Thundersoother (4): This set can outperform Gilded Dreams (4) in teams where she can keep high uptime on her Electro application.OFF-FIELD DPSThis build focuses more on making Lisa a flexible buffing/bursting unit in short durations as a part of a variety of teams including quickswap comps and, especially, Quicken comps.Regarding Weapon Choice:Kagura's Verity: This weapon's ranking is based on executing a specific rotation, but the rotation is different for Off-Field DPS. The rotation is Tap E > N2 > Tap E > Q > Hold E (3 Stack).Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: This option is only recommended on a low investment Lisa whereby she is focused around buffing her teammates and contributing team DPS over outputting high damage on her own.Regarding Stats Priority: These options prioritize Lisa's Elemental Burst uptime as a defense shredding tool.EM DPSThis build aims to be the consistent trigger for reactions, Hyperbloom and Overload are generally the best reactions for this set up. These reactions are primarily triggered by her burst, which is why it's important to make sure its uptime is as high as possible. Avoid having a second Electro in the Overload team for this build since this could mess up the Pyro aura Lisa wants for this playstyle. Regarding Weapons:Fruit of Fulfillment: At high refinement this weapon performs similarly to A Thousand Floating Dreams while also having a significant amount of Energy Recharge on it making it easier to build around.Regarding Artifact sets:Flower of Paradise Lost (4): This set only performs around 4-6% (varies according to the elemental composition of your team) better in terms of Hyperbloom damage. Therefore it's worth considering farming Gilded Dreams (4) instead since it's in a more resin efficient domain alongside Deepwood Memories (4).Regarding Stats Priority: Try to invest both into EM and ER. The goal is to try stack as much EM while getting enough ER for a comfortable Burst uptime depending on your teams.,

,NOTESIn-depth GuidefromRazor Mains + KQM,HYPERBLOOM / EM DPSHyperbloom / EM DPS Razor focuses on using his Burst's electro to trigger Hyperbloom. If you have C6 Bennett you can infuse Razor's Normal Attacks with Pyro to trigger Hyperbloom, Burgeon, and Overload. Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Greatsword: This weapon sacrifices some of Razor's potential reaction damage for team energyDPSRegarding Weapon Choices:Wolf's Gravestone: While the passive is inactive, this weapon outperforms Skyward Pride in every scenario except crowd battles.Beacon of the Reed Sea: Weapon ranking assumes one stack, at two stacks it outperforms the other weapon options. Redhorn Stonethresher: Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.The Unforged: The playstyle with this weapon becomes a lot more comfortable without having to worry about snapshotting Wolf's Gravestone / Song of Broken Pines buffs for Sub DPSes, while also granting more Shield Bonus for better Shield uptime. A shielder is required for this, with Zhongli being the most ideal option.Serpent Spine: At [C6] and high refinement Serpent Spine, it is better to run an ATK% Goblet over Physical Damage%. This is due to the oversaturation of damage bonuses (ascension stat + Serpent Spine) in addition to the fact that Electro accounts for a significant portion of Razor's damage. An in-depth explanation can be found here. It is also worth noting that an [R5] Serpent Spine with max stacks can outperform all 5✩ weapons at [R1].Skyward Pride: This weapon is viable with a Physical DMG goblet, as the damage dealt through its passive scales with Physical%.Regarding Artifact Sets: Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2): This set is better if your ATK% is covered by your substats, otherwise you would be better off running Gladiator's Finale (4). This is only recommended to those who have no immediate access to a decent Pale Flame (4) set, otherwise you would be better off investing on Pale Flame pieces, regardless of weapon choice.,

Flat ATK*Prioritize Energy Recharge first until you can burst off cooldown,1. Skill2. Burst,For her Elemental Skill to generate particles, you need to perform a Charged Shot to place a Crowfeather after casting her Elemental Skill. If the Crowfeather explosion hits an enemy, it generates 3 particles.Crowfeathers generated from Sara's [C2] do NOT generate particles.,
,NOTES,BURST SUPPORTSara is a quickswap support who is able to buff your active characters via its Crowfeather mechanics. When Sara uses her Elemental Skill, her next Charged Shot will leave a Crowfeather on the target location and after a short while, the Crowfeather explodes and the active character in its AoE will benefit from Sara's ATK buff, which scales with her Base ATK. At [C2], you can skip the Charged Shot as it immediately drops a Crowfeather, and save it for later on if you wanna swap back to her to extend her buffs. You can also use Elemental Skill followed by Elemental Burst so that she benefits from the Crowfeather dropped by her Elemental Skill, then swap to other character so that character can benefit from Sara's ATK buff. It's worth mentioning that Sara's Crit DMG buff at [C6] doesn't snapshot and it also doesn't show on the stats page, so don't freak out when you don't see it there.Regarding Weapon Choices: Weapons here are ranked based on their Base ATK to maximize Sara's ATK buff.Polar Star: This is the best weapon for her personal damage, at the cost of having weaker buffing capabilities compared to Skyward Harp.Skyward Harp: This is the best all-rounder weapon. Combining both high personal damage, with the second best buffing capabilities of any weapon.Mouun's Moon: At [R5] this weapon performs similarly to Hunter's Path in personal damage while also giving you a stronger buff.Elegy for the End: The cooldown on this weapon's passive aligns perfectly with Sara's Elemental Burst cooldown. This weapon has lower base ATK if compared with Skyward Harp, but this weapon can be considered over Skyward Harp since Sara is able to trigger the weapon passive quite easily with her Elemental Burst to provide your party members with another 100 EM and 20% ATK buff for 12 seconds, it also has Energy Recharge substat which is very valuable on a Burst Support Sara. Making it her best buffing weapon at the cost of significantly reduced personal damage.Sacrificial Bow: The combination of high base ATK and a Energy Recharge substat makes this one of her best (4✩) weapon options in teams where she needs a Energy Recharge weapon to meet energy requirements and battery another Electro unit at the same time.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4): Universal support set that is able to buff your party member's ATK by 20%, use this set on Sara if there's nobody else in the party who's equipping one.,

,NOTES,HYPERBLOOMThis is a Dendro team that requires a reliable Electro trigger unit to work,for which Kuki is one of the best Electro units to perform this role.Regarding Weapon Choices:Key of Khaj-Nisut: This becomes a better choice than Iron Sting at [C4] when you can gain the 3rd passive stack without extending your rotation time or taking extra field time. It can also net more Elemental Mastery than Freedom-Sworn at 3 stacks, assuming you have actually built some HP% Substats on your Sands/Goblet/Circlet, but this is usually not enough to out-perform the overall gains from Xiphos' Moonlight/Freedom-Sworn's respective passives.Toukabou Shigure: This weapon performs very similarly in a Hyperbloom focused build to Iron Sting since its passive does not effect Hyperbloom damage. AGGRAVATEThis adds flat damage to the triggering Electro attack that scales off Elemental Mastery and levels, which essentially allows Kuki's personal damage to become relevant while also filling the role of a healer in the team.Regarding Weapon Choices:For more details see the sheet hereFreedom-Sworn: While not having the highest personal damage it makes up for it in overall team damage through its competitive buffs.Primordial Jade Cutter: Has the highest personal damage of any weapon on Kuki but little to no utility, which means it usually falls behind in overall team damage.Key of Khaj-Nisut: On paper combines a mixture of high personal damage with team buffs to potentially be her best weapon if you manage to get it fully stacked. This is usually a unrealistic scenario though with it taking up to 2-3rotations to fully stack or forcing you to stay on-field to let it stack which is usually a net DPS loss.Regarding Artifact choices:For more details see the sheet hereThundersoother (4): It's potentially your BIS set if you can maintain a constant Electro aura or near that, to be this consistent usually takes up to 3 Electro units (or possibly 2 Electro units and a Anemo unit like Kazuha or Venti swirling Electro)Thundering Fury (2) +80 EM set (2) Noblesse Oblige (2): Usually performs so close to Gilded Dreams (4) that you can simply pick the set or combination of sets with the highest possible substats.SUPPORTOutside of reaction teams where she can be a reliable trigger unit, Kuki's damage contribution is usually insignificant. Hence her best usage case in those scenarios is building purely for utility.Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Sword: The passive lets her provide energy to the rest of the team. A Crit Rate circlet or substats should be considered to reliably trigger the passive.Freedom-Sworn: In teams where Kuki can reliably trigger reactions, the teamwide buff from this weapon can make it preferable over Favonius Sword.Key of Khaj-Nisut: Highest possible healing in exchange for weaker utility. Worth considering in teams that can't reliably trigger reactions for Freedom-Sworn or don't need extra energy particles from Favonius Sword.The Dockhand's Assistant: Similarly to Key of Khaj-Nisut, this weapon trades utility for stronger healing.Regarding Artifact Choices:Noblesse Oblige (4): When using this set, make sure to build enough Energy Recharge to cast Burst off cooldown and keep good uptime on this set's passive.Ocean-Hued Clam (4): Provides a decent amount of extra damage on a full healing build.Instructor (4) / The Exile (4): Can be a cheap alternative on teams where the extra ATK% buff from Tenacity of the Millelith (4) or Noblesse Oblige (4) is not as useful.,

,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM,PHYSICAL DPSThis section is dedicated to a playstyle where Keqing does not infuse her attacks with Electro, and instead focuses on Physical damage (white numbers). For this reason, you should be charged attacking after casting Stellar Restoration (E) instead of recasting it.Regarding Artifact Sets:Pale Flame (4): This set is the best by far as Keqing can proc its 4 piece set bonus instantly by charge attacking after casting E.Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2):  This set should only be used until getting Pale Flame (4).+25% Physical DMG set (2) +18% ATK set (2): The generalist Physical DPS set.Retracing Bolide (4): This set should only be used with a consistent shielder (i.e. Zhongli/Diona) for obvious reasons.Bloodstained Chivalry (4): This set is for general solo and Abyss content where there are multiple mobs that can be killed with charged attacks within 10 seconds, this is for dealing with a crowd, in other words, AoE. It is not recommended because of the kill condition.ELECTRO DPSRegarding Weapon Choices: Lion's Roar: This weapon is only recommended on Pure Electro / Electro-charged teams. In teams where the Electro Aura can be easily removed OR when facing enemies with innate elements, this weapon will severely underperform. Regarding Artifact Sets: Thundering Fury (2) +18% ATK set (2): This set is a generalist set, which means it can be used generally anywhere, whether it be Co-op or Abyss, or other singleplayer content. This has a lot of consistency due to its independence from Electro aura, and it is more viable in abyss.+18% ATK set (2) / +18% ATK set (2): While it is slightly behind Thundering Fury (2) +18% ATK set (2), this set is preferred to farm for due to the resin efficiency of Shimenawa's Reminiscence's Domain.Thundersoother (4): This set should be used with Electro-charged team compositions (Keqing + Xingqiu). This set has a 35% DMG modifier which increases all damage from all sources, although that modifier is a bit unstable due to its dependency to the sustainability of Electro aura on enemies.AGGRAVATE DPSRegarding Weapon Choices:Harbinger of Dawn [R5]: This ranking assumes full uptime on the passive. If you cannnot maintain the passive, this weapon is not recommended.Summit Shaper: This ranking assumes Keqing is unshielded. If Keqing has a shielder, this weapon will perform better than Harbinger of Dawn [R5].Toukabou Shigure: Eventually with high refinement Lion's Roar/The Black Sword will surpass it. But this ranking assumes [R1] for both, Iron Sting can also surpass it at equal refinement in Multi-target content where Toukabou Shigure's passive falls off, since it can only be applied to one target at a time.Wolf-Fang: This ranking assumes you are using Thundering Fury, when using Gilded Dreams or Split Set options instead it performs slightly worse than The Black Sword.Lion's Roar: This scales better with Higher refinement levels ([R5]) in comparison to The Black Sword.Regarding Artifact Choices:Gilded Dreams (4): This set encourages the use of ATK% Sands over an EM Sands.,

,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM,HYPERBLOOMIn this build Raiden is used as a Hyperbloom trigger unit in a Dendro team. She is one of the best units in the game for this role. Bringing greater energy particle generation, a faster rate of seed triggering and a team ult buff in exchange for reduced team flexibility compared to another top Hyperbloom triggering unit like Kuki.Regarding Artifact Choices:+80 EM set (2) / +80 EM set (2): In a team with one other Electro unit it's only 1 substat roll behind Gilded Dreams (4) (3-4 substat rolls behind in a team with no other Electro units) therefore you can usually just use the set with the most Elemental Mastery substat rolls on it.DPSRaiden's Elemental Burst damage depends on her team's energy consumption prior to her Burst, and her Burst restores a comfortable amount of energy for her team (which is further amplified by her passive). This is especially convenient on teams that doesn't conflict with her element and wants the energy provision. (i.e. Eula, Electro, National teams, etc.).Regarding Weapon Choices: This list assumes the average across a variety of buffs. Staff of the Scarlet Sands: It is not recommended to build EM for this weapon as her other offensive stats still outclass it.Skyward Spine: Assumes that you are utilizing the ATK SPD buff to access higher damage combos. Wavebreaker's Fin: At [R5], this weapon is competitive with the strong non-Engulfing 5* options, depending on your total team burst cost.Lithic Spear: The ranking for this weapon assumes 1 stack on its passive.Deathmatch: With refinements, Deathmatch becomes a very competitive option with some of the strong non-Engulfing 5* options, especially in single-target situations. Even at low refinement against a single enemy it is similar to R5 The Catch in terms of performance. Regarding Artifact Sets:Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set acts as a low investment support oriented set. Raiden is an excellent Tenacity of the Millelith (4) holder since her Elemental Skill has 100% uptime and procs very easily. Do note that if your Raiden is equipping this set, then she will sacrifice her personal damage.Regarding Main Stats Priority: Raiden's main stat priority for Sands and Goblet entirely depends on the substats, whether she has external buffs, and which weapon she is running. Using an optimizer/calculator would be the best way to work out your optimal setup.,

,NOTES,GENERAL NOTESRegarding Artifact Choices:Emblem of Severed Fate (4): This set works best for Yae in multi-target scenarios where her Elemental Burst hits multiple enemies and she is bursting every rotation. This set also provides more value if she's used WITHOUT Raiden or Fischl (due to the higher ER requirements).Golden Troupe (4): Yae's best artifact set in single target. It is also the preferred choice if Yae does not Burst.Thundersoother (4): Assuming you are able to maintain 100% uptime on its passive, this is competitive to be Yae's BiS set. This set works best for Yae in Electro-charged teams.Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set trades off a portion of Yae's damage in return for a party wide 20 ATK% buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (4) (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her. Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Yae.Regarding Talent Priority:  Do note that Yae's Elemental Burst does more damage than her Elemental Skill when it hits multiple enemies, and in some setups requiring high ER its more efficient to simply ult every second rotation rather than try to stack enough ER substats.OFF-FIELD DPSRegarding Weapon Choices:Solar Pearl: This weapon benefits a lot from refines and attack buffs like Bennett. [R5] Solar Pearl without buffs, or a low refine Solar Pearl with Bennett buff can perform similar to Skyward Atlas. Note that you should do a Normal Attack when you swap in and before you swap out of Yae Miko to keep good uptime on the passive.Hakushin Ring: This weapon's passive can buff your other team members, which may be more beneficial than Yae Miko's personal damage depending on the team and rotation used. Note that the passive cannot be triggered when off-field.Big thanks to Fob#6835 for helping us with the weapon/artifact rankings. OFF-FIELD AGGRAVATE DPSRegarding Weapon Choices:A Thousand Floating Dreams: The team EM buff this weapon provides may make it desirable over other options.The Widsith: At [R5] this weapon is equal to A Thousand Floating Dreams.Solar Pearl: At [R5] this weapon is better than Tome of the Eternal Flow.Hakushin Ring: This weapon's passive can buff your other team members, which may be more beneficial than Yae Miko's personal damage depending on the team and rotation used.

,NOTESIn-depth GuidefromCyno Mains,QUICKBLOOM DPSCyno in Quickbloom focuses both on doing high personal damage, but also proccing Hyperbloom with a Hydro unit on the team. This is his highest damage setup at [C0]. However, at [C2] and above Cyno can use Aggravate or other team compositions to similar or better effectiveness. **Weapon Rankings Assuming a Significant Amount of Hydro Application from an Off Field Unit**Regarding Weapon Choices:Dragon's Bane: In teams with a less consistent Hydro enabler such as Barbara, this weapon is worse than Deathmatch.Energy Recharge Weapons: In teams where energy is scarce, such as teams without another Favonius weapon or an Electro user, these weapons can be desired for the Energy Recharge it gives. Regarding Mainstat Choices:Any combination of Elemental Mastery, Electro DMG Bonus, and Crit Rate / DMG is effective on Cyno. With consistent Hydro application, his highest damage combination is Elemental Mastery Sands, Electro DMG Bonus Goblet, and Elemental Mastery Circlet. However, the mainstats are extremely close in damage, so it should be determined through the value of the substats on your pieces.AGGRAVATE DPSCyno is a DPS character that uses his burst to change stance and deal Electro damage. The damage dealt during this stance is Normal Attack damage so burst damage buffs will not affect him. Cyno in Aggravate focuses solely on doing high personal damage with his burst stance with other Dendro and Electro characters.Regarding Weapon Choices:Skyward Spine: In teams where Cyno does not need the Energy Recharge from this weapon it is worse than Missive Windspear.Kitain Cross Spear: This weapon is especailly competitive with the options higher on the list if Cyno is not being run with an Electro battery.Regarding Artifact Sets:Thundering Fury (4): In optimal conditions, this is Cyno's best artifact set. This set is an especially competitive option when Cyno is the only Electro character in the team, as the extra Elemental Skill casts help alleviate his energy issues. Do note that casting his skill off cooldown with this set might lead to missing Endseer stance windows. It is highly recommended to use a shielder with Cyno with this set.Gilded Dreams (4): This artifact set is better than Gladiator's Finale (4) on Staff of the Scarlet Sands and White Tassel.Thundersoother (4): If you can guarantee 100% uptime on this set, it performs better than Gladiator's Finale (4). However, satifying this condition is infeasible on most teams.Regarding Main Stat Choices:Sands: Elemental Mastery versus ATK% is heavily dependant on the weapon and team Cyno is in. It is recommended to test each and/or consult an optimizer.Circlet: With Staff of the Scarlet Sands, Elemental Mastery may be used as the circlet mainstat.,
