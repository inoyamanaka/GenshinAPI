,Notes,SUPPORTCollei is a Bow User who provides off-field support in Dendro application and damage.Regarding Weapon Choices:Polar Star: While this weapon provides the highest personal damage, it is generally not recommended as team buffs provide more teamwide damage over a small increase in personal damage. Sacrificial Bow: Not recommended below [R4] due to it delaying rotation, possibly resulting in damage loss.Regarding Artifact Sets: Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Collei's Sprout damage counts as Skill damage, which allows her to be able to keep Tenacity of the Millelith (4) up during important damage windows. Generally an alternative to Noblesse Oblige (4) or Deepwood Memories (4) (or if you are already running both in a team).Gilded Dreams (4): This set is only used in a team where Collei is used to trigger reactions (i.e. Bloom/Burning teams), and does not benefit Collei if she is used as an aura. The Exile (4): An alternative option if they are placed in the same team as Cyno to help his Energy Recharge needs.Shout out to Emiliabyss#1641 for providing an in-depth reference.,

Flat HP*Try to build some Crit Rate through substats if using Favonius Lance. Crit Rate is not important on other weapons.,1. Burst 2. Skill*Prioritize her Elemental Skill if you do not spend time on-field with Yaoyao after using her Burst.,The additional Yueguis summoned by the Burst are removed when Yaoyao leaves the field.If using Favonius Lance, you can perform Skill followed by two Normal Attacks in order to trigger the passive.,
,Notes,SUPPORT:Yaoyao focuses on healing and applying Dendro with her Elemental Skill and Burst. She can be used in a wide range of team archetypes, but do note her Dendro application from her Elemental Skill alone is generally insufficient for Bloom/Hyperbloom/Burgeon teams as a solo Dendro option. Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Lance: This weapon is a good generalist option for Yaoyao, providing Energy Recharge with a useful passive. Rightful Reward: This weapon performs worse if you are not planning to use Yaoyao's Elemental Burst.Kitain Cross Spear: This weapon can be better than Favonius Lance in teams where Yaoyao has a significant amount of Bloom ownership.Regarding Artifact Sets: Deepwood Memories (4): This set is the default option in teams where you care about reducing Dendro resistance and nobody else on the team is using it. Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set is a good option in teams where reducing Dendro resistance is not important, such as Yaoyao, Anemo, two Electro damage dealers (Aggravate).Instructor (4): Similarly to Tenacity, this set can be a good option in teams where reducing Dendro resistance is not important, or if someone else on the team is already using Deepwood Memories. Do note that Yaoyao has to trigger a reaction on-field to provide the 4pc bonus. Additionally, your stat potential on this set will be limited as it does not come in 5* rarity. Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This set is a good option in teams where you on-field Yaoyao and a supportive set is not needed. Flower of Paradise Lost (4)/Gilded Dreams (4)/EM (2) set mixes: These sets are specifically for teams where Yaoyao has a significant amount of Bloom ownership and is built with Elemental Mastery. Do note that Ocean-Hued Clam (4) can still be better in these teams, assuming you on-field Yaoyao. Regarding Mainstat and Substat Choices:In a Bloom team where Yaoyao has a significant amount of Bloom ownership, Elemental Mastery is preferred as a mainstat on your Goblet and Circlet, Elemental Mastery can also be used on your Sands if an Energy Recharge Sands is not required. Additionally, Elemental Mastery substats become good.,

,Notes,SUPPORT:Kaveh focuses on being the onfield unit for Bloom teams, boosting their damage with his Elemental Burst, and applying Dendro to create Bloom Cores.Regarding Weapon Choices:Wolf's Gravestone and Song of Broken Pines: In teams where the teamwide ATK% from the passive is not significant for team damage, it is advised not to use these weapons.Regarding Artifacts:Deepwood Memories (4): Do not use this set on Kaveh if another character is already using it.Ocean Hued Clam (4): This set has the potential to outclass Deepwood Memories (4) as long as another user can hold Deepwood Memories. It gets notably better at C1.Flower of Paradise Lost (4): This set can be better than Ocean Hued Clam (4) if Kaveh triggers the majority of Blooms in your team.Regarding Main Stats:Circlet: Crit Rate is only for Favonius Greatsword.,

She has the option to remain off-field for the majority of rotations, or stay onfield to drive and apply Dendro.Regarding Artifacts:Deepwood Memories (4): This set is highly recommended on Bloom-based teams and teams where there is a high volume of Dendro Damage provided no other unit holds this set.Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This is Kirara's best artifact set if you use her on-field.Regarding Main Stats:Circlet: Crit Rate is only for Favonius Sword.Regarding Substats:Crit Rate: only for Favonius Sword.,

Elemental Mastery3. ATK%4. Energy Recharge,1. Normal Attack2. Burst3. Skill,There are three recommended combos that Tighnari can perform:1. Skill -> Charged Attack -> Burst -> Charged Attack (x2) - This is the most mechanically difficult combo. However, this combo allows Tighnari to have both his Burst effected by A1 and funnel particles from his Skill to his next Burst.2. Skill -> Charged Attack (x3) -> Burst - Allows Tighnari's Burst to benefit from A1. However, this combo doesn't allow Tighnari to funnel particles from his Skill into his next Burst.3. Skill -> Burst -> Charged Attack (x3) - Simplest combo to use, and generally weakest combo though it allows prefunneling. His Burst does not benefit from A1 in this combo. It is recommended at C4 due to the EM buff.,
,NOTESIn-Depth Guideby KQM,QUICKSWAP DPSTighnari's standard build revolves around him doing his Elemental Skill, Three Clusterbloom Arrows, an Elemental Burst, and promptly swapping out to another character. Regarding Weapon Choices:The First Great Magic: Weapon ranking is assuming two Gimmick stacks. It performs a bit worse in solo Dendro, but still remains a good option. Elegy for the End: If Tighnari does not need the Energy Recharge that Elegy for the End provides, this weapon will perform worse than Scion of the Blazing Sun for his personal damage.Amos' Bow: This option ranks lower due to Tighnari not needing as much ATK%, as well as not stacking the passive wellScion of the Blazing Sun: At [R5] this weapon is equal to Thundering Pulse.Slingshot: Significantly worse when fighting from a long range.Range Gauge: This weapon is extremely strong if you can get three passive stacks. At [R5] with three passive stacks, this weapon performs similarly to Thundering Pulse.Song of Stillness: Weapon ranking assumes passive is active. At [R5], it performs similarly to Prototype Crescent [R5].Fading Twilight: If Tighnari does not need the Energy Recharge this weapon provides, it is similar to Prototype Crescent in terms of damage.Prototype Crescent: At [R5], this weapon is better than Slingshot. Notably, this weapon is heavily reliant on enemies having weakspots.Regarding Artifact Sets:Gilded Dreams: This set becomes better than Wanderer's Troupe if Tighnari uses his Burst every time he uses his Skill.Deepwood Memories (4): This is by far Tighnari's best set if no one else on the team is using it.,

,NOTES,Regarding Artifact Main Stats:Nahida has several viable combinations of main stats. The general rule of thumb is that the more EM mainstats you use, the better ATK%/Crit weapons will perform relatively.DPS & SUPPORTNahida can provide both damage, Dendro application, and buffs to her teammates. As such her build is focused on both maximizing her buff and her damage simultaneously.Regarding Weapon Choices:Wandering Evenstar: If teammates significantly benefit from the Flat Attack this weapon gives, it has the potential to rival A Thousand Floating Dreams.The Widsith, Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, and Solar Pearl: These weapons tend to perform better if Nahida is played on-field.Skyward Atlas, and Memory of Dust: The fewer the reactions Nahida triggers, the more potent these options become.Favonius Codex: This weapon has the potential to rival A Thousand Floating Dreams if Nahida can actively trigger the passive multiple times by attacking on-field. Favonius Codex also has the potential to be a good weapon on Nahida in teams where her Energy Recharge requirement is high.Hakushin Ring: This weapon should only be used if Nahida is used in Quicken or Hyperbloom teams.Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: This weapon sacrifices a lot of Nahida's personal damage for buffing potential. Generally not worth the trade, but can be usable in teams where Nahida's damage share is already low.Prototype Amber: Only to be used if the team otherwise lacks survivability.Regarding Artifact Sets:Deepwood Memories (4): This is her best set if no one else is wearing this set.Tenacity of the Millelith (4): In teams where Nahida's damage share is relatively low and there is another holder of Deepwood Memories and/or no need for the set at all, this can be Nahida's best set.Flower of Paradise Lost (4): This set is niche, but very powerful in Bloom teams where Nahida triggers the Bloom reaction.,

Skill2. Normal Attack~= Burst,Basic Rotations:Burst up = Q > E > N2D + 2N3D + N1C + 2N2CBurst down = E > N1C + 5N2C + N1The linked guide goes over his optimal rotations in more detail,
,NOTESQuick Guide fromKQM,SPREAD DPSThis playstyle makes the best use of Alhaitham's kit. Since both Spread reactions, his skill (the primary source of his damage) and burst scale heavily off Elemental Mastery. Further enhanced by his high rate of on-field Dendro application. All of this combined with his flexible teams and rotations makes him one of the best Spread DPS currently released. Lastly bear in mind that a large part of his damage comes from Dendro reactions (especially in Quicken/Quickbloom teams), which scale heavily off his levels, so you should prioritise levelling him to 90/90.Regarding Weapon Choices:Light of Foliar Incision: This weapon prefers EM sands even in situations with fewer or no Spread procs such as in Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom teams.Toukabou Shigure: This ranking assumes single-target situations, in AoE situations it starts falling behind weapons such as Iron Sting and Blackcliff Longsword.Harbinger of Dawn: If you can maintain near perfect uptime on its passive this weapon will perform similarly to weapons like Haran Geppaku Futsu.Xiphos' Moonlight / Festering Desire: These weapons can perform similarly to The Black Sword in teams where you have higher Energy Recharge requirements or want to burst every rotation.Wolf-Fang: At [R5], this weapon performs similarly to Haran Geppaku Futsu and Mistsplitter Reforged. Regarding Artifact Sets:Gilded Dreams (4): This ranking assumes that you already have another Deepwood Memories holder on the team, if not then Deepwood Memories becomes his best set.Deepwood Memories (2) / Emblem of Severed Fate (2) / +80 EM set (2): These split set options can actually perform similarly to Gilded Dreams (4) or even surpass it in situations where you have higher Energy Recharge requirements or want to burst every rotation. Or even if they just have better substat rolls on them.Regarding Mainstat Priorities: Usually in Quicken/Quickbloom teams Alhaitham leans towards Elemental Mastery sands (roughly 5% or so difference usually). But in Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom teams with, fewer to no Spread reactions, he skews more towards ATK% sands (unless you're using Light of Foliar Incision). Or even Energy Recharge sands if you're trying to burst every rotation for increased Dendro seed generation in those teams.,
,BAIZHU,ROLE,EQUIPMENT,ARTIFACT STATS,TALENT PRIORITY,ABILITY TIPS,
,WEAPON,ARTIFACT,MAIN STATS,SUBSTATS,
,,SUPPORT ✩,1. Jadefall's Splendor (5☆)2. Prototype Amber (4☆) [R5]*3. Favonius Codex (4☆)*4. Hakushin Ring (4☆)*5. Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers (3☆)6. A Thousand Floating Dreams (5☆)*,1.

Energy Recharge*2. HP%3. Flat HP4. Crit Rate**Prioritize Energy Recharge until requirement is met. Crit Rate is only recommended when using Favonius Codex.,1. Burst2. Skill,Baizhu's Elemental Skill has a 2-3 second delay between cast time and heal received, keep this in mind when swapping to low HP allies after Baizhu's rotation.,
,NOTES,SUPPORTBaizhu provides teamwide healing through the use of his Elemental Skill, and heals the active character from his Burst. The shields generated from his Burst should be considered as interrupt resistance as opposed to a reliable form of damage mitigation for non-Bloom reaction related damage sources. Due to being a Dendro catalyst, Baizhu can work effectively in a large range of different Dendro team archetypes. Regarding Weapon Choices:Hakushin Ring: This weapon is best used in Quicken teams when Baizhu is able to provide reasonable uptime on the buff. Prototype Amber: In addition to the amount of flat energy generation for the user, this weapon can provide significant team-wide healing when used in conjunction with Healing Bonus. It is a great option when using Baizhu with Furina for building Fanfare points from the second rotation onwards.Favonius Codex: Try to build some Crit Rate when using this weapon in order to trigger the passive effect more consistently. A Thousand Floating Dreams: This weapon can be considered in certain teams for the modest Elemental Mastery team buff it provides, though there are generally better uses for it. Regarding Artifact Sets:Deepwood Memories (4): Under AoE situations, it may be better for another party member to hold this set as Baizhu has lackluster AoE.Instructor (4): The Elemental Mastery gained from this set outweighs the reduction in A4 passive bonus from lower main stat values.Noblesse Oblige (4): In teams that benefit from ATK%, this set can be run over Instructor (4) if the additional sustain from higher HP values is preferred.Regarding Artifact Stats: While generally in teams that can benefit from Baizhu's Ascension 4 passive you want to build high HP (up to 50k) to maximize the buff it can provide, Healing Bonus circlet can be considered over HP% in teams where having more healing would be valuable. For example, using Healing Bonus circlet can allow for building Fanfare points faster when using Baizhu with Furina, moreover Healing Bonus circlet synergizes well with Prototype Amber's passive.,
