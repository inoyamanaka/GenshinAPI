Flat ATK**Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown,1. Burst2. Skill,Activating XQ's Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst applies Hydro to the on-field character with his shield. (Pyro in specific)Cleansing Electro may take an additional switch for your character with the rain swords active, while Cryo would freeze you in place. It is typicially recommended to use Xingqiu's Elemental Skill before his Burst. However, if Xingqiu is Constellation four, you may choose to use his Elemental Skill after his Burst for the increased damage. If you choose to do this, do two Normal Attacks after his Skill to ensure he catches his particles, or use the book trick method which involves pausing the game by opening a menu for a second to allow him to collect the particles.,
,NOTESGuide to be Updated Soon,OFF-FIELD DPSXingqiu's Off-Field DPS build centers on his ability to deal damage off-field with his Elemental Burst. His ER needs can change a lot based on team and constellations, and so do his list of recommended weapons. As such this serves a general idea of which weapons are most viable on Xingqiu.Regarding Weapon Choices:The weapon rankings assume you are running enough Energy Recharge to get Xingqiu's burst up off cooldown. If you are not, select an Energy Recharge weapon from this list.Wolf-Fang: At [R5] this weapon is about equal to Haran Geppaku Futsu and Mistsplitter Reforged. It surpasses these weapons if Xingqiu is used on-field.Finale of the Deep: This weapon's value depends on the healing capabilities of your team. It also scales heavily with refinements. At [R5] with a cleared Bond of Life, this weapon can rival Summit Shaper.Energy Recharge Swords: Weapons that provide some form of Energy regen for Xingqiu become more valuable in teams where Xingqiu requires more ER to burst every rotation.Favonius Sword: The Energy this weapon can provide to teammates is a useful support option and may lead Favonius to be better than the above options.Sacrificial Sword [R3+]: This weapon is extremely inconsistent and extends rotation lengths leading to an overall loss in DPS. This weapon does become more useful if Xingqiu is not the only Hydro character on the team. It is not recommended to use this weapon if it is not yet R3.Sapwood Blade: This weapon can be especially useful as a support weapon in Dendro based teams.Freedom Sworn: This ranking assumes Xingqiu can reliably proc the passive by triggering Elemental Reactions such as Electro-Charged or Bloom. The buff it gives to the team is not accounted for here, but it is worthy of noting.Lion's Roar: This weapon is particularly useful in teams where Electro or Pyro auras are present. If they are, this weapon can rival Summit Shaper.Big thanks to Quincy#6965 for helping us with the weapon calculations.Regarding Artifact Sets:Emblem of Severed Fate (4): This set falls off in terms of damage if Xingqiu has less than 130% Energy Recharge.Noblesse Oblige (4): Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can use this set on Xingqiu if nobody else on the party is able to use it better. If someone else on the team already has Noblesse Oblige (4), Noblesse Oblige (4) should not be used.Blizzard Strayer (4): This set is only recommended on a freeze team to optimize Xingqiu's stats since he can mildly disregard Crit Rate and build Crit Damage instead for more damage output. Despite it outperforming Emblem of Severed Fate (4) within this niche, it is generally not recommended to specifically farm for this set.Regarding Main Stats Priority:Ideally you would run an ATK% Sands when your ER needs are fulfilled. ER needs can be found in the Xingqiu Mastersheet.,

,NOTESIn-depth Guide from KQM,SUPPORTUse Elemental Skill and/or Elemental Burst and immediately switch. Building ER is not recommended on Support Barbara as her burst should be used as a last resort and should not be expected to be cast every rotation. This is further compounded by the fact that Barbara has no particle generation. Regarding Weapon Choices: Everlasting Moonglow: For Electro-Charged teams, this weapon will provide the highest personal damage for Barbara. However, Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers will still provide the highest team damage due to its 48 ATK% buff. Regarding Artifact Sets:Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This set is often the best option for support Barbara, as it provides healing bonus along with some personal damage through Clam procs. Instructor (4): The Hydro application from Elemental Skill can be used to trigger an elemental reaction and provide a teamwide Elemental Mastery buff.BLOOM DPSThis build is specifically for Bloom teams where Barbara is the character intended to trigger the majority of Blooms.Regarding Aritfact Sets:Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This set can do more damage than other options in certain situations, while also increasing Barbara's healing to deal with Bloom self-damage.,

Skill,In some teams, Candace's hold Elemental Skill cooldown is too long for rotations to work properly, so if Candace isn't C4, its recommended to avoid getting hit and to do a tap Skill as quick as possible.,
,NOTES,SUPPORTCandace is a 4* Hydro Support that specializes in providing off-field Hydro application with her HP% scaling Burst, infusing the autos of melee allies (Sword/Claymore/Polearm) with Hydro via her Burst's Prayer of the Crimson Crown effect, and providing defensive utility with her Elemental Skill. It is worth noting that Candace will never be the strongest option for your teams; at the cost of having different kinds of utility options in one kit, she will never be the best at them. Her damage contribution will be surpassed by other offensive-type Hydro supports like Xingqiu and her defensive capabilities are outclassed by the healing capabilities of the other Hydro healers. Thus, it is recommended to focus on her strength as a consistent Hydro applier by getting as much Energy Recharge as possible, which will help her maintain a consistent uptime on her Burst (her main source of Hydro application). For this reason, Candace's weapon and artifact rankings will focus on getting the highest amounts of Particle/Energy generation and Recharge.Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Lance: This is going to be Candace's BIS option because of her drastically high ER requirement. If she's the only Hydro character in one team, Candace will need nearly 300% ER to maintain a consistent burst uptime. With another Hydro character to help her out, this ER requirement is lowered down to the 200-250% ER range. This kind of ER requirement is difficult to reach with most polearms, but Favonius Lance makes it possible because each proc of its passive cuts down this requirement by 20% (1 proc --> -20% ER req). Note that with this polearm equipped, Crit Rate also needs to be prioritized on Candace to ensure that its passive is constantly proc'd.Engulfing Lightning: This polearm offers a large amount of ER%, which makes it the next best option for Candace after Favonius Lance.Staff of Homa and Deathmatch: These weapons can be considered if you want Candace to have high personal damage, which is usually notable at [C6]"The Catch": This polearm is going to be Candace's strongest F2P option, due to its high amount of ER and burst-enhancing capabilities.Regarding Artifact Choices: Emblem of Severed Fate (4) and Emblem of Severed Fate (2) + Hydro Damage Bonus/Noblesse (2): With Candace, the only "necessary" stat from her artifacts is the 20% ER you get from EOSF's 2-piece effect. Emblem of Severed Fate's 4-piece effect allows her to better capitalize on the high amounts of ER% that you'll be equipping on her, which makes it her strongest option. However, EoSF is a highly contested artifact set and thus it is possible for you to end up using the 2-piece + 2-piece alternatives listed above.,

Normal Attack,Optimal skill duration for [C0]: 7s, 9s or 12s.Optimal skill duration for [C1]: 9s, 11s or 14s.Melee Burst: Only to be used in situations where you need only 1 rotation to clear as the ER requirement to maintain burst uptime is quite high (170-190%), you'll always want to start your rotations with Ranged Burst since it refunds energy to maintain your rotation well.Skill Combo:- 2 NA + 1 CA (Optimal)- 3 NA + 1 CA (Recommended)- 5 NA + 1 CA (Recommended combo if using Rust or Thundering Pulse)*NA = Normal Attack, CA = Charged AttackThe Optimal combo provides more damage but consumes more stamina. Recommended combo provides slightly less damage but is stamina neutral and what most weapons should use.,
,NOTESIn-depth Guide fromChilde Mains,DPSThe Weapon Rankings here are under the assumption that Childe is used with Bennett and Vaporizes his Burst, aswell as using the optimal attack combos listed in the Ability Tips section.Regarding Weapon Choices:Polar Star: Has varied performance depending on how many passive stacks you get. Getting 2-3 stacks at the start of your rotation can perform better than Thundering Pulse while getting no stacks can perform worse than Skyward Harp.  This only applies if you are Vaporizing Childe Burst together with Bennett. In teams without Bennett, Polar Star will always perform better than the other options. 3 stacks can be achieved by doing Skill + 1 Normal + 1 Charged Attack before setting up your Vaporize Burst. If your Skill is still on cooldown, a fully Charged Aimed shot against a riptide affected target, OR a Ranged Normal + quick Aimed shot gives 2 stacks (which can be followed by Skill for the 3rd stack).Thundering Pulse: Slightly better than Skyward Harp depending on rotations - the more time you spend doing Normal Attacks, the more it pulls ahead over Skyward Harp, but it's not recommended to extend your Childe's melee rotation for this.The Viridescent Hunt: Offers a valuable passive that helps a lot in grouping enemies, which can offer a ton of damage from Riptide.Blackcliff Warbow: Due to inconsistency of gaining stacks, falls off compared to other weapons at higher refinements.Prototype Crescent: Requires you to trigger its passive by hitting the enemy's weak points, falls off if compared with other options without the passive triggered.The Stringless: Main DPS Childe should only use this weapon in teams where you are Vaporizing your Burst, as the Elemental Mastery substat loses a lot of value in other teams. If Childe is being used as a Nuke Support only for his Vaporized Burst damage, R5 Stringless will rank just below Thundering Pulse. Note that the Stringless Elemental Skill passive does not affect Childe's melee stance auto attacks.Regarding Artifact Sets:+15% Hydro DMG set (2) +18% ATK set (2): This set is only about 1-2 substats behind Heart of Depth (4), you can opt out for this set instead if you already have decent pieces.Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): Due to this set requiring Childe to have around 150% Energy Recharge to reliably burst every rotation, it falls behind the other options. However, it outperforms Heart of Depth (4) if used in a single rotation setting (ignoring ER).,

Skill,Mona's Burst applies bubble and Omen debuff upon cast, the count down timer only begins when the bubble is broken.Frozen enemies can have their bubbles preserved as long as enemies stay in a frozen state. This technique makes Mona a priority Support for Freeze DPS teams.,
,NOTES,DPSThis build is best utilised at [C2], but can work without it. Do note that several 4 stars will out-dps Mona, as Mona is better off as a Sub-DPS/Support.NUKEMona's Elemental Skill provides taunt and procs wet status on enemies, her Elemental Burst is also capable of rendering smaller enemies immobile (Mona needs to be at least 20 levels within the enemy's level) and providing a huge damage burst (and additional omen debuff after proc).Regarding Artifact Sets:Instructor (4): A niche set only really used for certain Hu Tao teams nuke setups.Look to the Nuke Mona's Ability Tip section for Vaporize Nuke set up instructions.BURST SUPPORTMona can use her Burst to apply the Omen debuff on enemies and allow teammates to deal more damage. This is most commonly seen in freeze teams. Mona's main role on a freeze team is to provide Omen debuff from her burst as it is extendable via Freeze mechanics. Note that you must apply Cryo before casting Mona's Elemental Burst for the extension to happen. Omen Freeze extension can be done by reapplying Cryo and Hydro aura consistently (this can be done with Cryo / Hydro infused Venti Elemental Burst + on-field Cryo / Hydro aura).Regarding Weapon Choices:Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: Generally the best option on Freeze Support Mona because she can furthermore buff the ATK of your Main DPS. This however comes with an assumption that with Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, you still have 100% Elemental Burst uptime. If you do not, pick the other Energy Recharge weapon options for more Elemental Burst uptime.A Thousand Floating Dreams: If the team does not need Elemental Mastery this weapon should not be used on Mona. If the team does need Elemental Mastery and does not benefit heavily from ATK%, this weapon can compete with Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers.Regarding Artifact Sets:Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Run this set if there's already another character with Noblesse Oblige (4) on the team.,

,NOTESIn-depth GuidefromKokomi Mains + KQM,SUPPORTSupport Kokomi focuses on just using her Elemental Burst before her Elemental Skill's duration ends to refresh her skill duration. This allows 100% uptime on Hydro application from her Elemental Skill for Freeze / Electro-charge teams.Regarding Weapon Choices:Hakushin Ring: This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in Electro-charged teams and will outperform Prototype Amber if you value damage more than healing.Sacrificial Fragments: Can be useful as Kokomi won't need to use her Elemental Burst to reset her skill duration. This allows for smoother rotations as she will not face the problem of missing out on the reset for her Elemental Skill due to not casting Burst in time.Regarding Artifact Sets:Tenacity of the Millelith (4): With proper extension of Kokomi's Elemental Skill, she can maintain near 100% uptime on this artifact set's 4 piece effect.Ocean Hued Clam (4): This ranking assumes Kokomi is being used only for her Elemental Skill. If she is being used to attack onfield during Elemental Burst, this set may overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4). Regarding Main Stats and Sub Stats: Energy Recharge: Prioritise Energy Recharge first to ensure you can always use Elemental Burst before the Elemental Skill expires in order to maintain Hydro application. DPSDPS Kokomi aims to maximise her onfield damage during her Elemental Burst's duration. Outside of her Elemental Burst, her damage is lackluster and not worth building for.Regarding Weapon Choices:Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: Although this weapon doesn't provide as much personal damage for Kokomi, the 48% ATK buff is usually more worth in most cases. This can be her best weapon in for overall team DPS if you don't already have another Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers user in your team.Hakushin Ring: This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in Electro-charged teams, and is the best choice in those situations.Regarding Artifact Sets:Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Although this set offers the lowest personal damage for Kokomi, the 20% ATK team buff can sometimes be better for overall team DPS.BLOOM DPSThis build is specifically for Bloom teams where Kokomi is the character intended to trigger the majority of Blooms.Regarding Aritfact Sets:Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This set can do more damage than other options in certain situations, while also increasing Kokomi's healing to deal with Bloom self-damage. However, this set is very resin inefficient and is thus not recommended to farm specifically for this set.,

Getting enough Energy Recharge for this is important, and varies based on team. Since the casting time is so long, it may not be worth snapshotting into buffs.The amount of slashes Ayato can do during an Elemental Skill window is sometimes influenced by the player's set FPS.,
,NOTESIn-Depth Guideby KQM,DPSDPS Ayato focuses on doing large amounts of on-field damage with his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst. Regarding Weapon Choices:Skyward Blade and Amenoma Kageuchi: If you are running Ayato in teams where he needs more than 140% ER to burst, these weapons can be quite valuable.Summit Shaper: In teams where ATK buffs are scarce, this weapon has the potential to rival The Black Sword.Finale of the Deep: If you can reliably clear the Bond of Life, this weapon ranks equal to Summit Shaper.Lions Roar: In Electro-Charged teams, this weapon performs about equal to The Black Sword.Regarding Artifact Sets:Echoes of an Offering (4): The performance of this artifact set is inconsistent, and is based on user ping and other factors. It is not recommended to run this set unless your ping is consistently below 100. If you can achieve this, Echoes of an Offering (4) is only preferred on weapons with high amounts of DMG% such as Mistsplitter Reforged and Haran Geppaku Futsu. Otherwise, Heart of Depth (4) is preferred.Blizzard Strayer (4): When run in a Freeze Team, this is Ayato's best set. Note that it is not recommended to farm specifically for this set.Thundering Fury (4): When run in an Electro-Charged team, this is Ayato's best set due to the Cooldown Reduction on Elemental Skill allowing for shorter rotations.

,NOTESIn-depth Guide from Yelan Mains,OFF-FIELD DPSYelan is an off-field DPS who is able to apply Hydro via her Elemental Burst, this part of her kit acts similarly to Xingqiu's Elemental Burst. Yelan mainly scales off HP%, so don't build her with ATK%. Yelan also wants a lot of Energy Recharge to be able to maintain her Elemental Burst uptime, this can decrease depending on the number of Hydro units or energy providers in the team.Regarding Weapon Choices:Elegy for the End: This weapon is to be used only in reaction based comps such as Vape Hu Tao, Yelan's personal damage is lower than other options on this list, but is more beneficial for the team's damage per rotation.Mouun's Moon: This weapon works best at [R3+] and makes HP% Goblet potentially a stronger option instead of Hydro Bonus especially in comps with strong DMG% buffs.Sacrificial Bow: This ideally needs to be at refinement [R3-R5] to function properly in most Yelan teams rotations without desyncing the rotation and extending her field time.Aqua Simulacra: Can still perform well at high Energy Recharge as long as your minimum Energy Recharge requirements are met.Hunter's Path / Polar Star / Thundering Pulse: These weapons are stronger than Stringless, however Yelan does not utilize them optimially. If you have another character that benefits from these weapons, it's recommended to prioritize these weapons on them, since these weapons are very small upgrades over Stringless. It is not recommended to pull these weapons for Yelan specifically.Regarding Artifact Main Stats:Goblet: HP% Goblet is to be used only if the Hydro DMG% option has terrible substats and HP% option has great substats, or if Yelan has strong DMG% buffs such as Emblem of Severed Fate (4) + Mouun's Moon (especially with refinements) or Raiden + Kazuha and so on.On top of that it's never recommended to run more than 2 HP% mainstat artifacts at a time.Regarding Talent Priority:Normal Attacks: Level this up only if you want to constantly use her Breakthrough Barbs.Big thanks to Vladone ツ#9281 and jstern25#1399 from Yelan Mains for helping us with the calculations.,

BurstTalent levels do not affect Nilou's buff to Bloom damage, so heavy investment in Talents is not necessary,,
,NOTESQuick Guidefrom KQM,BLOOM SUPPORTAs a Bloom Support, Nilou's role is to maximize a team's Bloom Damage in teams of strictly Hydro and Dendro characters. Level 90 is highly recommended to maximize Nilou's HP and Bloom DamageRegarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Sword, Festering Desire and Sacrificial Sword: Strong options if opting to Burst every rotation. Favonius can potentially help other team members' energy needs. Do bear in mind though that Nilou strongly prefers Elemental Mastery weapons over Energy Recharge weapons in almost all circumstances.Regarding Artifact Sets:+80 Elemental Mastery set (2): These sets provide no benefit if Nilou isn't triggering Blooms.+15% Hydro DMG set (2): This is only really a viable option if Nilou is played mostly on-field instead of off-field.Deepwood Memories (4): Can be an option if other teammates are not Deepwood Memories holders.,

,NOTES,OFF-FIELD DPS & SUPPORTFurina buffs team members with her Burst, and deals off-field damage with her Skill.Regarding Weapon Choices:Key of Khaj-Nisut: Three stacks of this weapon is extremely reliable as long as Furina's Skill hits opponents. It can help elevate the team's damage with its teamwide EM buff.Non-Energy Recharge Weapons: These see better performances when Furina is used in teams with lower Energy Recharge Requirements. Favonius Sword: The value of this weapon can fluctuate based on Furina's Energy Recharge requirements and the team's Energy Recharge Requirements.Regarding Artifact Main Stats:Goblet: HP% is recommended with Golden Troupe (4) as an artifact set, elsewise, Hydro DMG is recommended. At C2 the two become roughly similar, assuming Golden Troupe (4).,
