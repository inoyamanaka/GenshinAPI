Flat HP*Crit Rate substats are only recommended when using Favonius Warbow.,1. Burst = Skill*,Diona's Elemental Skill grants you a Cryo shield which allows cleansing. Every time you swap characters with the shield up, it applies Cryo. This acts as a cleanse.,
,NOTES,SUPPORTAs a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing, and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo damage dealers such as Ayaka, Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into them while providing them a shield. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow greatly increase her potential as a battery.Regarding Weapon Choices:Sacrificial Bow: Preferred over Favonius Warbow at higher refinements when batterying another Cryo character.Favonius Warbow: It is recommended to build some Crit Rate in substats to have a higher chance of triggering the bow passive for energy.Recurve Bow: This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, however the Energy Recharge and useful passives of other weapons will generally make it a suboptimal pick.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4): This set provides an teamwide ATK% buff while also increasing burst damage - Diona does not have the best uptime on this set, however, she may be the best option to use this set.Instructor (4): This set is a niche option for Diona. It can be considered in teams which value EM and where she can trigger a reaction while on-field. Do keep in mind that Instructor being limited to a 4* set means your stat potential will be lower. Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set is a niche option for Diona. It can be considered in teams including some variants of Ganyu Freeze which have shorter rotation lengths meaning Diona's burst will not be used every rotation, and where you can snapshot the ATK% buff onto Ganyu's burst. Regarding Main Stats Priority: Full Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. You can use Healing Bonus Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two. Regarding Talent Priority: Prioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.,

Burst = Skill*,Chongyun's Elemental Burst is calculated as Claymore damage, which means it breaks Geo Structures / Shields at a much easier rate and can proc Shatter.,
,NOTES,BURST SUPPORTIt is preferred to use Chongyun as a Sub DPS / Nuke over Main DPS as his Normal Attack scalings are very low, even when including Constellation 1. His Elemental Burst on the other hand hits extremely hard on later constellations and takes a much higher total damage portion over his Normal Attack. On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.Chongyun is very niche as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an enabler, be it for Reverse Melt teams (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or Freeze teams (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also does not function well with Physical teams (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo. They're usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, they won't benefit from Physical DMG Bonus from the goblet, thus it's a DPS loss.At [C2], his Elemental Skill reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%. This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.Regarding Weapon Choices:Serpent Spine: This weapon outperforms Wolf's Gravestone if we only look at Chongyun's damage contribution [5 Stacks Assumed]. Wolf's Gravestone is ranked higher as it provides more teamwide DPS and does not come with the need to acquire stacks before engaging in combat.Redhorn Stonethresher and Beacon of the Reed Sea: Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, these weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage. Beacon ranking assumes one stack.Akuoumaru: At [R1], Akuoumaru beats Luxurious Sea-Lord if Chongyun is used in a team with 260 or greater total team energy. Akuoumaru only beats Luxurious Sea-Lord if [R2] and above otherwise.Sacrificial Greatsword: This weapon is your best choice if faced in a situation where you heavily rely on Chongyun's Cryo infusion uptime.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4): Chongyun is one of the best Noblesse Oblige (4) holders since he has low energy requirements for his Elemental Burst.Gilded Dreams (4): Gilded Dreams is a good set on Chongyun in teams where he Melts his Burst.Regarding Talent Priority: Prioritize Elemental Burst on a Melt team as it scales better than his Elemental Skill.Prioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.,

,NOTESIn-depth GuidefromKaeya Mains + KQM,FREEZEKaeya Freeze is mostly used in a team with Chongyun and Xingqiu/Barbara while having Blizzard Strayer (4) equipped. In this team, Kaeya has 55% crit rate against Frozen enemies without any additional Crit stats, which means Crit Rate substats are generally prioritized less than ATK% or Crit DMG.REVERSE MELTKaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Cryo application for characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his Cryo damage is split into a barrage of attacks.Regarding Weapon Choices:Skyward Blade: In teams with a 2nd Cryo unit generating energy, this weapon would have a lower priority as the Energy Recharge stat would mostly be wasted.Lion's Roar / The Alley Flash / Iron Sting: At [R5], these weapons would outperform Summit Shaper.Regarding Artifact Sets:Instructor (4): Due to his ability to easily trigger Instructor's (4) passive, Kaeya is a good holder of Instructor (4) for Reverse Melt teams. Aside from ER%, most of his other main stats don't matter as much, making this one of his budget support builds. Noblesse Oblige (4): This set is only recommended if there is no other member of the team running Noblesse Oblige (4).,

,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM,REVERSE MELTThis build capitalizes on the fact Rosaria's skill and burst dont have an ICD, allowing her to Melt all Skill and Burst procs. Which in combination with snapshotting buffs onto her burst makes it one of her highest personal damage builds.Regarding Weapon Choices:For more details see the sheet hereVortex Vanquisher: The ranking assumes you are unshielded. If you use a shield, it can surpass Calamity Queller.Dragon's Bane: At high refinement [R4-R5] this performs a tad better than Primordial Jade Winged-Spear.Wavebreaker's Fin: At high refinement [R4-R5] with a 260 energy cost team this performs just below Staff of Homa.Deathmatch: This weapon can outperform all (4✩) options and even Primordial Jade Winged-Spear when used with Gilded Dreams (4) in single target situations.Regarding Artifact Choices:Emblem of Severed Fate (4): In teams where her energy requirements are higher (130%+) it can surpass Gilded Dreams (4).FREEZEThis build can be used on both a quickswap/sub-dps and perma-freeze dps Rosaria. If played as a perma-freeze dps, Rosaria has the same team comp as Freeze Kaeya. Check Kaeya's ability tips section for teamcomp setup.Regarding Substats: Rosaria does not need much Energy Recharge if paired with Kaeya. If paired with another Cryo unit such as Chongyun or Ayaka, she will need more Energy Recharge.Compared to Kaeya, Rosaria has even less desire for Crit Rate, as her Ascension 1 Talent includes an extra 12% Crit Rate once skill hits the back of an enemy.Regarding Weapon Choices:Wavebreaker's Fin: At high refinement [R5], this weapon can perform similarly to Staff of Homa, and even outperform it with a high energy cost team (260 cost).Deathmatch: Rosaria gets a lot of Crit Rate from Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance. As a result, this weapon falls off in value as you will tend to overcap above 100% Crit Rate. If Rosaria is being used without the Blizzard Strayer (4) set, then this weapon can perform better compared to other options.Regarding Artifact Choices:Noblesse Oblige (4): This set is only used in her sub-dps/quickswap roles not her perma-freeze dps role. Also it should only be considered when you have no decent Blizzard Strayer (4) pieces and no one else on the team is holding Noblesse Oblige (4).SUPPORTThis Build focuses on her Buffing/Energy generation/Cryo application capabilities. Though it does not mean that you dont invest in her personal damage, only that it's a lower priority overall.Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Lance: The best option in situations where you havent met your teams energy requirements. Outside of that scenario you would be better of using a Crit Rate weapon that benefits her A4 buff.Regarding Artifact Sets:Instructor (4): Can be the better option in teams that prefer the Elemental Mastery buff over ATK, such as Hu Tao VapeMelt.,

,NOTES,SUPPORTMika is a Physical damage support who offers Physical DMG% through Detector Stacks, and Physical Crit Damage at C6. He is additionally able to heal and provide some Attack Speed. Do note that Mika's buffs apply to your on-field character and do not linger, this is something to keep in mind especially when playing him with Eula, as you will lose his buffs if you detonate her Lightfall Sword early. Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Lance: This is Mika's best in slot option, as both an Energy Recharge weapon and one with a useful passive which generates particles on Crit. Weapons which provide Energy Recharge are prioritized to ensure good Burst uptime.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4) is Mika's best set if nobody else is using it.Ocean-Hued Clam (4) is a good option if another party member is using Noblesse Oblige (4).Regarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats:A Critical Rate circlet can be considered when running Favonius Lance for more consistent procs.

,NOTES,SUPPORT ✩Charlotte supports the team through her healing, and minor off-field damage. Though she has ATK% scaling on her healing, her personal damage is rather poor and support based artifacts and weapons are recommended.Regarding Weapon Choices:Wine and Song: It is very important to sprint before casting Charlotte's Elemental Burst so that she gains the extra ATK% for her burst.Ballad of the Boundless Blue: In teams where Charlotte triggers elemental reactions more frequently, this weapon will perform better than Fruit of Fulfillment.Hakushin Ring: This weapon fulfills its niche if Charlotte is used in Superconduct teams.Regarding Artifact Choices:Blizzard Strayer: The main utility for this set is more consistent Favonius Codex triggers. However, it also slightly helps her damage, which can be valuable at higher Constellations.Regarding Substats:Crit Rate: Only more useful than Crit DMG when using Favonius Codex.,

,NOTES,SUPPORTQiqi's Burst has an 80 energy cost with her skill not generating any energy until [C1]. Energy Recharge will greatly benefit Qiqi, while her Burst should be kept as a last resort.Qiqi's Burst allows other characters to maximize DPS field time while offering healing from being off-field. At Ascension 4, her Normal Attack applies the healing talisman onto an enemy with a cooldown of 30 seconds.Regarding Weapon and Artifact Choices:Sacrificial Sword and Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Using Tenacity of the Millelith (4) allows Qiqi to give the team a decent ATK boost while staying in enemy melee reach with Skill active. Sacrificial Sword increases the uptime of her Skill, which in turn increases the uptime of the team's ATK boost. If you find that your Qiqi's heals are often more than enough, you may consider switching her to this artifact set. Do note that other characters might utilize Sacrificial Sword more than Qiqi, such as Xingqiu, Kazuha, etc.Ocean Hued Clam (4): This ranking assumes Qiqi does not get her Elemental Burst up often and is instead relying mainly on her Elemental Skill for healing. If she is in a team which funds her enough energy particles, or if she acts as the on-field DPS, this set can overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4).,

,NOTESIn-depth GuidefromGanyu Mains + KQM,MELT DPSGanyu's Level 2 Charged Shot applies two instances Cryo as they do not share the same ICD, which allows you to trigger Melt reaction twice for both damage instances. Charged Attack will be the majority of her damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution for most scenarios.Regarding Weapon Choices:Amos' Bow: This is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3 stacks of Amos' Bow passive even on point blank range.Hamayumi: Due to its passive, this weapon prefers Wanderer's Troupe (4) instead. At higher refinements, Hamayumi can outperform Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp.Scion of the Blazing Sun: At [R5], Scion of the Blazing Sun can outperform Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp.  Prototype Crescent: At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. Regarding Artifact Sets:Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) and Wanderer's Troupe (4): If you are able to squeeze 5 Charged Attacks during the 10 second buff duration, Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) pulls ahead of Wanderer's Troupe (4). Due to it being very difficult to do, Wanderer's Troupe (4) will usually end up dealing more damage for most players. Note that unless you intend to artifact strongbox Wanderer's Troupe pieces, Shimenawa's Riminiscence (4) remains the better set to farm as the domain is greatly resin efficient.Regarding Talent Priority:Ganyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it doesn't steal your Melt reaction.FREEZE DPSFreeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.Regarding Weapon Choices: Polar Star: This weapon is much harder to optimize with, due to having a very high Crit Rate stat resulting in your Crit Rate going well above 100%. However, if optimised properly (i.e. very little Crit Rate substats), it performs similarly to The First Great Magic.Aqua Simulacra: Due to the sheer amount of Crit stats you can get from Blizzard Strayer (4), Ganyu's ascension passive and this weapon itself, you can consider running an ATK% circlet, especially if it has better substats than your Crit DMG one.Amos' Bow: In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.Prototype Crescent: Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5 star options such as Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly. Regarding Artifact Sets:Blizzard Strayer (4): This set is the go to set for a Freeze team comp due to the huge stats it provides.OFF-FIELD DPSAn Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100% Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party members' Cryo Damage. Regarding Weapon Choices:Prototype Crescent: This weapon might pull ahead of some of the other options if you activate the buff before casting Elemental Burst.Elegy for the End: Offers party-wide Elemental Mastery and ATK buff which is quite nice on reaction heavy team comps.Regarding Artifact Sets:Blizzard Strayer (4): This set offers a huge amount of stats, use this set only if your Ganyu is used on a Freeze team.Noblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Ganyu with more utility so that she can buff your whole party's ATK by 20%.,

,NOTES,DPSWeapon rankings are assuming 130% ER minimum. Regarding Weapon Choice:Redhorn Stonethresher: This weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in terms of Eula's own damage if team provides enough ATK buffs, but Wolf's Gravestone can make up the damage difference by buffing team damage.Skyward Pride: This weapon is more forgiving towards ER substats. If there is a Cryo battery unit in your team (Diona with Sacrificial Bow or Kaeya with Favonius Sword) or if your team generates enough particles on their own, Skyward Pride loses effectiveness compared to the above options. Akuoumaru: This weapon will outperform Luxurious Sea-Lord at higher refinements.Beacon of the Reed Sea: Weapon ranking assumes one stack. At two stacks, it outperforms other weapon options. Tidal Shadow: Weapon rankings are assuming the passive is active.Serpent Spine: Weapon rankings are assuming max stacks, in practice this often means running a shielder. Regarding Artifact Sets:Pale Flame (4): This is Eula's optimal artifact set and it relies on having a condition fulfilled in order to outperform Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2). If you are able to sustain the conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG Bonus + 18% ATK. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can sustain the Pale Flame's 4 piece set bonus because each stack lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula's Elemental Skill cooldown is only 4 seconds when doing 1-taps, therefore you can keep the condition up. When using this set, it is recommended to not use Hold Skill cast until your Lightfall Sword is nearly about to end. This restriction is only for players who don't have Eula [C2+]. Please visit the Ability Tips for her combo.Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2): This is a non-conditional, consistent artifact set that provides you a constant 50% Physical DMG bonus. While that by itself is amazing, Pale Flame (4) can outperform this set because it also has another 18% ATK buff and is easily maintained through her low tap skill cooldown.,

Burst2. Normal Attack3. Skill,Ayaka's Charged Attack, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst is able to hit enemies inside sucked inside Venti's Elemental Burst.Her Elemental Burst also stays in place on frozen enemies and slightly knocks enemies away when they're not frozen.,
,NOTES,DPSKamisato Ayaka is a pretty straightforward DPS that deals most of her damage from her Elemental Burst. She has very high scalings on her burst at the cost of it being 80 energy. You will likely need another Cryo battery on the team to provide energy for her (Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, etc). She has a special dash (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion on her Normal Attacks. Ensure you always have this bonus active to maximise your rotation damage.Regarding Main Stats Priority:Circlet main stat will be dependant on your overall stats, depending on your overall stats, one can be better than the other. Since Ayaka is able to get a lot of Crit Value from Blizzard Strayer (4) set, ascension passive, and also possibly weapons, ATK% circlets can be competitive to Crit ones, it also has a better drop rate, so don't throw away your good ATK% circlets.Regarding Weapon Choices:Primordial Jade Cutter: With Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so try to avoid getting Crit Rate substats.Finale of the Deep: Weapon rankings are assuming you clear the Life Bond. If you cannot clear the Life Bond, it performs similarly to Amenoma Kageuchi.Aquila Favonia: While Aquila Favonia has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it has a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive, however, it's not a huge upgrade over the other 4 star options and there might be a character which can utilize this weapon better (such as Bennett).Skyward Blade: The Energy Recharge main stat provided from this sword makes Ayaka comfortable in terms of having a good burst uptime, try to avoid getting Energy Recharge substats since the weapon already provides you with enough Energy Recharge.Amenoma Kageuchi: Lowers Ayaka's Energy Recharge requirement which allows her to allocate some of her Energy Recharge substats to other offensive substats. Harbinger of Dawn: A good Crit statstick if you can keep the requirements up (having >90% HP).,

,NOTES,BURST SUPPORTAloy is much preferred as a Burst Support over Main DPS as getting coil stacks for her Cryo infusion can be quite unreliable. Aloy needs 4 coil stacks to get the Cryo infusion and you can only get 1 stack every 0.1 seconds which is quite hard to do considering the Bomblets are scattered all over the place. One thing to note regarding Aloy's coil stacks is that she can still get coil stacks even when she's off-field.Aloy is very niche as she only performs well in certain comps and even then, she's still completely replaceable by other characters. She can be utilized on a Freeze team where she can be a battery and nuke at the same time since she provides 5 Cryo particles on her Elemental Skill. She can also be utilized on a Melt team where you can melt her Elemental Burst for quite a decent amount of damage.Regarding Weapon Choice:Polar Star: Forcing to get Polar Star stacks isn't worth due to consuming extra time to get those stacks.The Stringless: Placement was considering Aloy is used on a Reverse Melt team. On Reverse Melt Aloy Stringless, especially at higher refinement levels, can pull ahead of Thundering Pulse.Prototype Crescent: Assumes the passive is active by proccing a weak point shot. This weapon especially at higher refinement levels can be as good as Skyward Harp.Sacrificial Bow: A pretty decent option to make Aloy a Cryo battery as her Elemental Skill provides 5 Cryo particles.Regarding Artifact Sets:Blizzard Strayer (4): This artifact set is best used on a Freeze-focused Aloy as it provides a ton of Crit Value.+80 EM set (2): This artifact set bonus only benefits a Melt-focused Aloy, Elemental Mastery provides nothing on a Freeze Aloy.Noblesse Oblige (4): Aloy is one of the best Noblesse Oblige (4) holders since she has low energy requirements and cooldown for her Elemental Burst.Regarding Artifact Main Stat and Substats Priority: Elemental Mastery is only an option if your Aloy is played on a Reverse Melt team as it provides nothing to a Freeze Aloy.,

,NOTES,SUPPORTShenhe is a Support for Cryo characters, capable of providing damage buffs from her Elemental Skill and dealing damage while providing Cryo and Physical resistance shred from her Elemental Burst. Her Elemental Skill gives a few stacks of additional flat damage bonus to all nearby party members (5 stacks on Tap and 7 stacks on Hold). This additional flat damage bonus only works on Cryo attacks, so characters who don't use Cryo attacks don't benefit from Shenhe's Elemental Skill, do note that Cryo infusion from Anemo characters does act as a Cryo attack, so it benefits from Shenhe's Elemental Skill. Another thing to note is that the additional flat damage bonus Shenhe provides uses Shenhe's current ATK, so it doesn't snapshot.Regarding Weapon Choices:Calamity Queller: The passive of this weapon works perfectly with Shenhe's Elemental Skill because it's dynamic. This weapon also has high Base ATK which makes ATK% substats really effective.Engulfing Lightning: This weapon provides Energy Recharge and converts Energy Recharge to ATK, which benefits Shenhe a lot.Vortex Vanquisher: This weapon's passive can't be stacked off-field, but it's still an ATK stat stick which provides Shenhe with a lot of ATK.Favonius Lance: With this weapon, it is better to have some Crit Rate on Shenhe for the weapon passive to proc (Do note that Cryo Resonance provides 15% Crit Rate on Cryo-imbued enemies, so the need for Crit Rate on Shenhe is lowered). With refinements especially, Favonius Lance can outperform 5* options under some conditions.Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority:Crit Rate substats become more relevant when using Favonius Lance.,

,NOTES,MELT DPSWriothesley utilizes the Melt reaction to deal increased damage with his attacks. Weapon rankings assume you use Bennett. Regarding Weapon Choices:Flowing Purity: This weapon is more potent if you can reliably clear the Bond of Life. If you can, this weapon is equal or better than Ballad of the Boundless Blue [R5].MONO CRYO / FREEZE DPSWriothesley can use the Mono Cryo and Freeze teams to benefit from Cryo resonance. However, as Wriothesley's CA shatters, Freeze is not extremely consistent. Mono Cryo removes the Freeze aspect in order to slot another Cryo support. Regarding Weapon Choices:Flowing Purity: This weapon is more potent if you can reliably clear the Bond of Life. If you can, this weapon is equal or better than The Widsith.Regarding Artifact Set Choices:Blizzard Strayer (4): Wriothesley shatters Freeze which makes this set lose valuable uptime. Unlike Marechaussee Hunter (4), it cannot be used in Melt teams, and loses versatility.,
