ATK%4. Crit Rate / DMG,1. Skill2. Burst*Sucrose's Talent Levels are not a necessity.,When utilized as a Viridescent Venerer (4) artifact set holder, make sure you don't immediately swap away after casting Skill/Burst, you need to be on-field when the swirl reaction happens for you to trigger the 4-set effect.,
,NOTES,EM BUILDSucrose's Ascension 4 Talent boosts the entire team's EM by 20% of Sucrose's total EM, this is why you want to stack as much Elemental Mastery as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most of Sucrose's value lies on her Ascension 1 and 4 talents, hence leveling her other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, Burst) is not required.Regarding Weapon Choices: Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: This weapon does not provide any EM, however it overtakes the other weapons on the list when it comes to buffing your team. It offers 48% ATK boost to the character you swap to which is equivalent to 1 main stat. This buffs your DPS more compared to Sacrificial Fragments which gives ~44EM, equivalent to only 2 substats.Hakushin Ring: This weapon is a good option for teams where Sucrose can swirl Electro to trigger its damage-boosting passive. In Electro-Charged teams, she can buff Hydro DMG% as well.Favonius Codex: This weapon can be useful if you value the extra energy generation from the passive. You may need to get a few Crit Rate substats to trigger the passive reliably.There are some team compositions in which Sucrose's Elemental Mastery is not a priority, such as Freeze teams or an Anemo battery for Xiao. In such situations it's better for Sucrose to use Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers.,

,NOTES,SUPPORTSayu does more damage with EM builds and heals more with ATK hybrid builds, Healing Bonus circlet's can be used for better heals while maintaining respectable damage. Note that Sayu wants a large amount of Energy Recharge when used as the only Anemo slot on the team.Regarding Weapon Choices:Wolf's Gravestone: This is a universal claymore that is capable of buffing your teammates along with providing more healing in Sayu's case. It is best used once you achieve your ER threshold.Forest Regalia: When used in its niche with aggravate teams it can outpeform Katsuragikiri Nagamasa. Outside of that its just a Energy Recharge% stat stick.Regarding Artifact Sets:Viridescent Venerer (4): The bread and butter artifact set for Anemo units, this set provides the ability to shred the enemy's elemental resistance while also buffing Sayu's Swirl damage output.Ocean-Hued Clam (4): This artifact set trades Sayu's utility in favor of stronger healing and some extra damage. It is generally not recommended to farm this set for Sayu specifically.,

,NOTES,ANEMO DPSShikanoin Heizou's Anemo DPS build is roughly equal to his Elemental Mastery build assuming he isn't being used in an Electro-Charged team, He has very low Energy Recharge needs. At [C4] he can run 100% Energy Recharge.Regarding Weapon Choices:Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds: In teams where Shikanoin Heizou and Bennett are used in the same team, this weapon is better than Skyward Atlas.The Widsith: The Widsith provides the highest possible critical hit single strike damage for Heizou. However, its long cooldown leads it to lack consistency, and it has a chance of obtaining the relatively useless EM buff for Anemo DPS Heizou.Regarding Artifact Sets:Viridescent Venerer (4): This is both Shikanoin Heizou's best personal damage set, and his best set for supporting the team.EM DPSShikanoin Heizou does not get the same benefits from an EM build as other Anemo users do. He still has to level his talents, and allocate substats into offensive substats such as attack and crit to equal Anemo DPS. However it is notiably better than Anemo DPS build if used in Electro-Charged teams.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4): Only use this set if you already have a Viridescent Venerer (4) user on your teamSUPPORTSupport Shikanoin Heizou forgoes his personal damage for support capabilites. However, none of Heizou's support abilities are dependant on his stats and instead comes in the form of a flat 80 Elemental Mastery to all party members. He can run any artifacts to help his DPS.Regarding Weapon Choices:Hakushin Ring: In Electro-Charged teams, this can be used to buff both Anemo and Electro damage, and scales well with refines. It is recommended to run Anemo DMG based artifacts on this build.Prototype Amber: In teams where there is no healer, Shikanoin Heizou can use this weapon to help the team's survivability.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige/Instructor (4): Only use this set if you already have a Viridescent Venerer (4) user on your team,

Normal Attack,Regarding Optimal RotationsFor funneling particles to Faruzan:Skill --> Charged Shot --> BurstFor funneling particles to other units:Skill --> Burst --> Charged ShotAt C6 bear in mind the Charged shot portion of the rotation no longer becomes necessary since your burst will start activating the Pressurized Collapses instead.,
,NOTESQuick Guidefrom KQM,SUPPORTAs the premier Anemo support unit for Anemo dps based teams, Faruzan combines both high Anemo damage buffing with Anemo resistance shredding to become a cornerstone of any team that wants to focus on Anemo damage. Though building her means primarly focusing on dealing with her high energy requirements.Regarding Weapon Choices:Elegy for the End: Usually only a better option at higher constellation levels such as [C6] where her energy needs can be met without Favonius passive particles.Sacrificial Bow: It's worth mentioning that the extra Pressurized Collapse from a second E wont give you any extra particles if it's within her 5.5 second particle generation cooldown.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4): This is her best option in teams that either won't benefit significantly from Viridescent Venerer (4) shred, or teams that already have another unit holding the aforementioned set.Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This has similar usage cases to Noblesse Oblige (4), except in that it requires Faruzan C6 for improved uptime through extra Pressurized Collapse activations.Emblem of Severed Fate (4): This set will give Faruzan her best personal damage output, assuming the team is already running Viridescent Venerer (4). Also if you're willing to invest more time farming substats it can potentially give you more Energy Recharge than running The Exile (2).Golden Troupe: This set is better than Emblem of Severed Fate (4) if Faruzan is C6 because of the pressurized collapse damage.,

Skill,,
,NOTESQuick Guidefrom KQM,OFF-FIELD DPSLynette serves as a burst-oriented Anemo unit, that unlike other Anemo units does not excel in any one category such as personal damage, crowd control and buffs. Her potential for crowd control is partially dependent on unlocking her C1 and C4, and neither her ATK buff nor her personal damage reach notably high levels. What truly distinguishes her among Anemo characters is her unique capability to utilize ousia-aligned attacks as a Fontaine character. This distinct trait enables her to neutralize specific enemy mechanics by triggering annihilation reactions, as part of the overall Arkhe mechanic.Regarding Weapon Choices:Freedom-Sworn: While this is her best buffing weapon it would be extremely difficult to meet her Energy requirements without a Energy Recharge weapon especially while primarly using her as an off-field unit.Sacrificial Sword: Ideally you would want higher refinement levels as in [R3]+ so its cooldown aligns better with your rotation.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (4): This is a good option for her in teams that either won't benefit significantly from Viridescent Venerer (4) shred, or where putting it on her is the lowest total team damage loss.Emblem of Severed Fate (4): This set will give Lynette her best personal damage output, assuming the team is already running Viridescent Venerer (4).,

,NOTES,BURST SUPPORTJean's Elemental Skill can be used to fling smaller mobs into the air to deal fall damage, and to stagger bigger ones. Her healing scales with ATK.Regarding Weapon Choices:Amenoma Kageuchi: This weapon can lower your ER% requirements, depending on the number of stacks on the passive and the refinement of this weapon. As such, at higher refines / more stacks on the passive, this weapon can perform better than Skyward Blade, while at lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.Lion's Roar: Depending on passive uptime, it can be ranked much higher in terms of Jean's personal damage.Regarding Artifact Sets:Viridescent Venerer (4): The bread and butter for Anemo characters in general, as it is commonly used for the 40% elemental resistance shred.Noblesse Oblige (4): Another option for providing utilities to the team. This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.Ocean-Hued Clam (4): The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to prioritize utility options such as Noblesse Oblige (4) or Viridescent Venerer (4) over this set.Regarding Main Stats Priority:Elemental Mastery should only be used when Jean is paired with Bennett, as her burst ticks will swirl the self applied Pyro from Bennett's burst, acting as a damage source and Pyro application. Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons with EM and ER passives are preferred. (Freedom-Sworn, Skyward Blade,  Favonius Sword, Sacrificial Sword, Iron Sting, Amenoma Kageuchi).While typically Jean will heal enough that you do not need to try and build for as much healing as possible, when paired with Furina it can be beneficial swapping to an ATK% goblet and Healing Bonus circlet. This is to aid in building Fanfare points faster, and Jean's personal damage is not particularly significant to begin with. When building Jean in such a way, prioritize weapons which provide ATK% or Energy Recharge.  Regarding Talent Priorities: If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.For Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime. Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.EM DPSEM DPS Jean relies on her unique interaction regarding her Elemental Burst. If the active character if afflicted by Hydro / Pyro / Electro / Cryo, Jean's Burst will infuse them with Anemo and create a swirl trigger around the character. This interaction can be abused by using Bennett to consistantly infuse the active character with Pyro. This allows for an extremely high amount of Pyro Swirl triggers. These swirl's damage scales off of Jean's Elemental Mastery.,

,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM,REACTION OFF-FIELD DPSThis build focuses on damage over ER because of his ER ascension stat. This weapon order is in the assumption of EM VentiRegarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Warbow: While terrible for personal damage, this weapon allows Venti to provide more energy for his teammates, while also covering his ER needs. Finding Crit Rate in substats is recommended for consistent passive procs. If Venti does significant damage with Elemental Reactions, or triggers other Elemental Reactions, the value of this weapon becomes lower.Elegy for the End: The ATK buff of Elegy for the End DOES NOT buff Venti's burst if Venti is the one equipping the bow, but the EM buff affects Venti's Swirl reaction. This is due to Venti's burst snapshotting his stats (excluding EM toward transformative reactions such as Swirl) at the time of cast. While an [R1] Elegy for the End yields slightly lower Venti damage compared to an [R5] Stringless (~7% assuming 50% Elegy buff uptime), it provides a party-wide ATK and EM buff which can be better in terms of total team damage and comfortable ER.Alley Hunter and Mouun's Moon: At [R5] These weapons perform better than Favonius Warbow.ANEMO OFF-FIELD DPSRecommended only in situations where Venti recieves a lot of buffs from teammates (e.g. Bennett, Faruzan) and doesn't trigger reactions such as Aggravate or Electro-Charged.Regarding Weapon Choices:Elegy for the End: Elegy is about equal to Alley Hunter in terms of DPS, but its teamwide buffs make it a more worthwhile choice on Venti.Regarding Mainstats: Goblet: The Goblet can be ATK% or Anemo DMG, generally choose the one with better substats. If Venti's Stormeye's absorbed element is further boosted (e.g. Shenhe for Cryo) then an ATK% Goblet will be preferred.,

,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom Xiao Mains + KQM,DPSXiao has issues with energy generation because he cannot generate any particles with his Elemental Skill while his Burst is active, so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during Elemental Burst.Before swapping to Xiao, often you would cast the Skill of your Anemo battery (e.g Sucrose) and then cast his Skill twice followed by Burst. You will want to be half way through your Burst animation before the particles reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion of the energy gauge already filled.You'll want to pair Xiao with a battery, which would often be another Anemo character (e.g C6 Faruzan, Sucrose, Jean) to help with energy generation. Xiao's Elemental Burst ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per cooldown.Regarding Weapon Choices: Weapon rankings are assuming Bennett and C6 Faruzan. Do note that weapon rankings can vary depending on your buff assumptions, please refer to the In-depth Guide linked for weapon rankings including other buff scenarios. With a good battery, Xiao does not need a significant amount of Energy Recharge to maintain high Burst uptime, though the amount of Energy Recharge needed will vary on your team and clear times (e.g whether you can clear within 2 rotations). Calamity Queller: This weapon has a really high Base ATK, which means it benefits more from ATK% buffs (e.g. Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers) if compared with other weapons.Vortex Vanquisher: In teams with fewer ATK Buffs such as from Bennett / TTDS this weapon will perform slightly better than Calamity Queller, or when using Marechaussee Hunter (4) while shielded and fully stacked it can even perform slightly better than Staff of Homa in teams with Bennett and Faruzan. **Important Note** Weapon rankings are not assuming an Energy Recharge minimum. This means that weapons such as Skyward Spine, Engulfing Lightning and Favonius Lance may be stronger than reflected in this ranking. Regarding Artifact Sets: Desert Pavilion Chronicle (4): If Xiao has a weapon with low Base ATK in a team with a lot of external ATK buffs like Bennett or Thrilling Tales of the Dragons Slayers this artifact set can be equal to or better than Vermillion Hereafter (4).Marechaussee Hunter (4): While worse than Vermillion Hereafter (4) on most weapons, MH provides a significant amount of Crit Rate. Do keep in mind that due to Xiao's ascension stat being Crit Rate, it may be difficult to optimize around this set if using Crit Rate weapons. Prioritize +15% Anemo DMG set (2) over the other +18% ATK set (2) sets if there are external ATK% buff sources on your team. Emblem of Severed Fate (2) can be used if you lack Energy Recharge substats while using a non-Energy Recharge weapon. Regarding Artifact Main Stats: Anemo DMG% goblets are recommended for Xiao. ATK% goblets serve as a good alternative for him.,

Skill = NA***For an EM-focused build, upgrading Kazuha's talent levels isn't a necessity.*Note that upgrading Kazuha's NA talent increases the damage of his plunge attacks.,The element which is absorbed by Kazuha's elemental burst follows the priority of Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo, and can be absorbed from both the active character and enemies. (i.e. Standing in Bennett 's Elemental Burst will result in Kazuha's Elemental Burst infusing Pyro as Bennett's Elemental Burst applies Pyro to the active character),
,NOTESIn-depth Guidefrom KQM,REACTION DPS & SUPPORTKazuha's 4th Ascension Passive encourages players to maximise Elemental Mastery in order to maximise his utility and increase his Elemental Reaction damage.Regarding Weapon Choices: The ultimate goal is to try stack as much EM while getting enough ER for a consistent Burst uptime. Having any of the ER swords or a second Anemo character in the team will also help reduce the needs for ER and prioritize EM substats more.Favonius Sword: With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.Sacrificial Sword: It is generally not needed to use the additonal instance of Kazuha's Elemental Skill should Sacrificial Sword proc its passive, unless you absolutely need to use it for extra grouping.Sapwood Blade: Only really viable at high refinement in specific Dendro teams where you can trigger Dendro reactions usually through swirling Electro/Hydro on enemies with Dendro applied to them (most consistently done in Aggravate reaction comps).Regarding Artifact Sets:Thundering Fury (4): This is a niche build that excels only in AoE situations and with specific teams. Those teams include an off-field Hydro and Electro support to allow Kazuha to constantly trigger the 4pc effect and spam his Elemental Skill, aswell as another Anemo support to hold the Viridiscent Venerer (4) set. Such teams can be Kazuha + Kokomi + Fischl + Venti, with Barbara and Sucrose being weaker replacements for Kokomi and Venti. This team triggers multiple fall damage instances against enemies that can be Crowd Controlled by Kazuha. Fischl can use The Viridiscent Hunt bow to allow for more fall damage instances. **NOTE: This team performs very poorly in pure single target situations.,

Instead, bursting every other rotation is preferred.Regarding Weapon Choices:Memory of Dust: This weapon can pull farther ahead than other options if Wanderer is shielded. If shielded, it maintains its ranking without Bennett, and performs better than The Widsith with Bennett.Dodoco Tales [R5]: This weapon uses a different rotation of E N1 CAx6 N1 CAx6 to maximize its passive. The Widsith: Because Wanderer doesn't focus on Swirl damage, this weapon can be inconsistent if you get the EM buff. Regarding Artifact Sets:Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): If Wanderer is C2 or higher it is not reccomended to run this set.Echoes of an Offering (4): If your ping is above 100, it is not recommended to run this set specificallyBlizzard Strayer (4): This set synergizes well with the 20% Crit Rate that Wanderer gets from swirling Cryo. It is only recommended if you have close to 100% uptime on Freeze, which requires very specific teams. Despite this, with 100% Freeze uptime, this set is still worse than Desert Pavilion Chronicle (4).Lavawalker (4): In teams with consistent Pyro application, this set is about equal to Echoes of an Offering (4).Viridescent Venerer (4): In teams where the majority of the damage share is not linked to Wanderer, and there is no other viable holder of the set, he may use Viridescent Venerer (4).,
