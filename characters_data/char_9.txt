Skill,Ningguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating energy, so for the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst uptime, wait 6 seconds to cast again if you need energy. It also breaks when casted on top of another Geo Structure, you can intentionally use a structure to break your first screen.,
,NOTES In-depth Guideby KQM,DPSDue to Ningguang having a really low Base ATK and no ATK conversion mechanics, external ATK buffers such as Bennett is recommended as a support for Ningguang to bump up her ATK stat.Regarding Weapon Choices:Skyward Atlas: Without Bennett, this weapon performs better than Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.Memory of Dust: Without Bennett, this weapon performs better than Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds and Skyward Atlas.The Widsith: At [R5] this weapon performs better than Kagura's Verity on average.Flowing Purity: Ningguang's best F2P weapon. Becomes stronger if you can clear the Bond of Life every rotation, which makes a healer more valuable in her team.Solar Pearl: At [R5] this weapon performs better than The Widsith [R5] and Kagura's Verity. It is recommended to add a Normal Attack before casing Ningguang's other abilities.Hakushin Ring: This weapon performs better than Mappa Mare when an Electro character is in the party.Regarding Artifact Sets:Emblem of Severed Fate (2): This set performs worse than other options when Ningguang does not need to build Energy Recharge%.Thundersoother (4): This set performs better than Archaic Petra (2) Emblem of Severed Fate (2) if an Electro aura is always present on the enemy.Lavawalker (4): This set performs better than Archaic Petra (2) Emblem of Severed Fate (2) if a Pyro aura is always present on the enemy.Archaic Petra (4): This set tends to be the best set for overall team damage in many cases. However, Archaic Petra is extremely resin-inefficient to farm and is therefore only recommended to be farmed over time from the artifact strongbox.Emblem of Severed Fate (4): This set will perform better than Archaic Petra (2) +18% ATK set (2) if you need the Energy Recharge and you do not use Charge Attacks more than normal.Husk of Opulent Dreams (4): This set performs on par with Archaic Petra (2) +18% ATK set (2) with its inclusion in the strongbox it has become a strong generalist option.,

,,DPS ✩,1. Redhorn Stonethresher (5✩)2. Serpent Spine (4✩)*3. Skyward Pride (5✩)*4. Whiteblind (4✩)5. Favonius Greatsword (4✩)*[C6] is assumed for this ranking.,1. Husk of Opulent Dreams (4)*2.

Energy Recharge3. DEF%,1. Normal Attack2. Burst3. Skill,Optimal attack rotation is N1>N2>N3>N4>dash/hop, where N refers to each normal attack in her 4 hit combo. This isn't always feasible due to cast time and N4 covers a lesser AoE than N1-3 (as well as knockback issues), so the recommended rotation is N1>N2>N3>dash/hop.,
,NOTES,DPSIt's recommended to avoid building a DPS Noelle if she's not [C5+].Noelle DPS is best optimized at [C6] where she converts an additional 50% DEF into ATK. Her ability to sustain her team with shields, heals and AoE damage makes for a reliable DPS when your team is built around her.Regarding Weapon Choices:Serpent Spine: When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).Skyward Pride: Useful if you are unable to get ER from your substats. Does really well while its passive is active, but falls off in sustained fights. Comfort option that can lose to a high refined Whiteblind with stacks.Favonius Greatsword: Only recommended with high refines, as its usefulness scales with its particle generation capabilities. [R5] allows her to self-battery assuming some additional particles from enemies, but a second Geo is always recommended regardless for resonance. Regarding Artifact Sets:Husk of Opulent Dreams (4): Noelle snapshots her DEF on burst cast. To get the full 4 stacks' DEF% boost during your first burst, you need to wait 12 seconds off field before swapping in. In abyss, time spent before the chamber starts still generates stacks.Retracing Bolide (4): Optimally offers slightly less damage than Gladiator's Finale (4), but is much easier to farm per resin and can have 100% uptime with crystallise shields. Consider Gladiator's Finale if you don't want to farm for Archaic Petra as Artifact Strongbox is much more effective than elite bosses in terms of artifacts per resin.,

,,SUPPORT ✩,1. Favonius Warbow (4✩)2. Sacrificial Bow (4✩)3. Elegy for the End (5✩)*,1. The Exile (4)*2. Noblesse Oblige (4)*3. Emblem of Severed Fate (2) +20% ER set (2),Sands - Energy RechargeGoblet - Geo DMG / DEF%*Circlet - Crit Rate / DEF%* / Healing Bonus*,1. Energy Recharge2. DEF%*3. Crit Rate*,1. Skill,[C2] extends the duration of Gorou's Elemental Burst from 9 seconds to 12 seconds if you can obtain the required Crystallize shields. This allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last ability before swapping into your DPS.,
,NOTES,SUPPORTGorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at 3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG% Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field following the active character which deals periodic damage and offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He can see niche use at [C6] with other Geo characters as well.Regarding Weapon Choices:Elegy for the End: Elegy offers a helpful ER substat alongside an EM and ATK% buff for your teammates. While not directly useful in teams centered around Noelle or Itto, this could possibly be a good choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which utilizes Geo Resonance.Regarding Artifact Sets:The Exile (4): Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each of your party member. This set reduces your Energy Requirements by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34% difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual substat value.Noblesse Oblige (4): The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt for this instead. Regarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats Priority:DEF% mainstats and substats (and potentially a Healing Bonus mainstat on Circlet) can be considered at [C4] due to being able to heal the active character based on his DEF during burst. This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.Crit Rate circlet and substats can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat, as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.,

,NOTES,SUPPORTYun Jin is a Support character for Normal Attack focused characters who can deal off-field damage via her Elemental Burst. Yun Jin's Elemental Burst grants nearby party members 30 stacks of additional flat damage bonus on Normal Attacks which scales with Yun Jin's current DEF. This means that external DEF buffs like from Gorou's Elemental Skill and/or Burst doesn't provide much to Yun Jin since it only buffs active characters and not off-field ones.Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Lance: With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.Kitain Cross Spear: Although the EM mainstat isn't useful for Yun Jin, the passive decreases her Energy Recharge requirements by a lot, especially at higher refinements. It can reduce her ER% reqs depending on refinement. Note that she must cast Elemental Burst first before Skill, as the passive drains 3 energy initially when Skill is cast. This weapon can be left at level 1 while still getting full effect from the passive.Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority:Crit Rate should only be considered when Yun Jin is equpping Favonius Lance to reliably proc the passive.,

,NOTES,PHYSICAL DPSOptimal Physical Rotation:Normal Attack until Spear Kick -> Dodge/Jump Cancel -> RepeatSHIELD SUPPORTThis kind of playstyle is very straightforward; stack as much HP as possible. Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.Note that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable.Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority:Crit Rate should only be considered when Zhongli is equpping Favonius Lance to reliably proc the passive.Regarding Weapon Choices:Favonius Lance: Use this weapon over Black Tassel if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive)Regarding Artifact sets:Archaic Petra (4): Can be more useful than Tenacity of the Millelith (4) in teams that dont scale as well with ATK buffs or already have another Tenacity of the Millelith holder. Though it can be an awkard set to utlize well without extending rotation times, since the Holder of the set (Zhongli in this case) has to pickup the shard for the buff to take effect.Deepwood Memories (4): This set works best in Dendro reaction focused teams (Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom/Spread) that prefer having Deepwood Memories on Zhongli so that they can run more damage focused sets such as Gilded Dreams / Flower of Paradise Lost instead for the highest overall damage gain. That said it means keeping the enemies near your pillar's to have good uptime on the Dendro resistance shred effect, which can be difficult with no grouping abilities in a team.Instructor (4): This set is usually only used in a few heavily reaction focused teams, such as Ganyu Melt or Hu Tao Vape, where you're maximising your damage in exchange for a stronger shield. Though Zhongli's shield is still usually more than strong enough even with fewer substat rolls to strengthen it.BURST SUPPORTZhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy). His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage. Though in certain teams without either very high investment into his damage or enough time in the rotation to burst without extending rotation times his burst can be a DPS loss.Regarding Artifact Main Stats:ATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands.Regarding Artifact Sets:Noblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of Severed Fate (4).Noblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set.Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also provides Zhongli with stronger shields.,

Burst**Albedo's Burst is not used in some teams, namely Geo teams such as Itto, Albedo, Gorou, Flexible. In such cases, you do not need to level it.,Albedo's Elemental Skill particle generation is completely RNG like Zhongli, but with better odds.,
,NOTESIn-depth GuidefromAlbedo Mains + KQM,OFF-FIELD DPSAlbedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.Regarding Weapon Choices:Harbinger of Dawn: Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.Mistsplitter Reforged: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.Freedom-Sworn: Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.Wolf-Fang: Weapon rankings use [R5] as it performs worse than Harbinger of Dawn at lower refinements, even at [R5] it is a very marginal upgrade. It's worth noting the Crit Rate passive of Wolf-Fang does not stack off-field, you can perform Skill>N1>Swap character instead of just Skill>Swap character, for two stacks instead of one, but the difference isn't significant. Regarding Artifact Sets:Husk of Opulent Dreams (4): Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.Golden Troupe (4): With Cinnabar Spindle, this set performs similarly to Husk of Opulent Dreams (4), and slightly better than Husk with the addition of Gorou and another Geo teammate assuming Spindle still. With Harbinger of Dawn however, this set performs worse than Husk of Opulent Dreams (4). Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.Noblesse Oblige (4): If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.Archaic Petra (4): This set is a niche option for Albedo. It is lower personal damage than several other set options, but can be a reasonable option in some teams for buffing other characters. Do note that the 4pc bonus requires you to pick the shard up on Albedo. Regarding Artifact Substats Priority:ATK% and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.,

Flat DEF6. Flat ATK,1. Normal Attack2. Burst3. Skill,,
,NOTES,DPSArataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesagiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's current DEF to ATK.Regarding Weapon Choices:Serpent Spine: When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).Skyward Pride: Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.Whiteblind: Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.Regarding Artifact Sets: Retracting Bolide (4): This set grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli.,
